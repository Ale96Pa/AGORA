    """
    Queries the incident opened_at and closed_at from the database and processes it
    to return data for visualizing active and closed incidents over time along with severity levels.

    Args:
        db_path (str): Path to the SQLite database file.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary with the following structure:
            {
                'opened_incidents': [

                    ...
                ]
            }

    Interpretation:
        - Each list contains daily time series data.
        - 'opened_incidents': Number of incidents opened on each date (cumulative).
        - 'active_incidents': Number of incidents that are active (open but not yet closed) on each date.
        - 'closed_incidents': Cumulative number of incidents closed up to each date, with breakdown by severity.
        - 'closed_selected_incidents': Number of incidents closed in the selected period (not cumulative), with breakdown by severity.
        - The 'time' field is a string in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format.
        - The 'low', 'moderate', 'high', and 'critical' fields represent the cumulative or period-specific counts of closed incidents for each severity level.
