148,1,"The incident management process shows a **low compliance cost of 0.0474**, which is a positive indicator, especially considering updated interpretations for repetitive detection and awaiting activities, and N*RC variants. However, this internal process efficiency does not translate to external commitments, as the **SLA achievement rate remains critically low at 44.43%**. This poor SLA performance is primarily driven by an **unacceptable average time to resolve incidents of approximately 15.14 days**. While 1598 incidents were closed, including 7 critical and 103 high-severity ones, the slow resolution time represents a significant operational bottleneck.

**Recommendation:** Urgently investigate and address the underlying causes of the prolonged average time to resolve incidents to improve the critically low SLA achievement rate and meet contractual obligations."
148,2,"The incident management process shows a favorable **low compliance cost of 0.0474**, supported by the re-categorization of specific deviations (repetitive detection, awaiting, and N*RC variants) as non-process errors. Despite this internal efficiency, the **SLA achievement rate remains critically low at 44.43%**. This poor performance is primarily driven by an **unacceptable average time to resolve incidents of approximately 15.14 days (21807.82 minutes)**.

149,1,"Despite clarifications on repetitive 'detection' (N) and 'awaiting' (W) activities, and direct 'N->R' transitions due to merge rules, the incident management process continues to exhibit critical compliance issues. Average state durations for 'detection' (4d 6h 35min), 'activation' (8d 18h 55min), 'awaiting' (16d 8h 10min), and 'resolution' (5d 22h 11min) remain critically prolonged, far exceeding non-acceptable time thresholds and indicating severe bottlenecks. Furthermore, missing 'N' (319) and 'A' (544) activities, along with repetitive 'A' (1990) and 'R' (119) and mismatch 'A' (115) and 'R' (45) deviations, all significantly exceed their respective acceptable thresholds. Remediation requires immediate investigation into the root causes of these persistent prolonged state times and widespread deviations in 'detection', 'activation', and 'resolution' to enforce process adherence."
149,2,"The incident management process exhibits critical non-compliance, with a calculated cost of 140.9, far exceeding the 'critical' threshold of 0.3.

Despite reclassifications for repetitive `detection` and `awaiting` activities and 'N*RC' variants, substantial non-compliant deviations persist, including 319 missing `detection` activities, 544 missing `activation` activities, 1990 repetitive `activation` activities, and 115 `activation` mismatches, all significantly above acceptable thresholds. Remediation requires immediate investigation into the root causes of these persistent prolonged state times and widespread deviations in `detection`, `activation`, and `resolution` to enforce process adherence."
149,3,"The incident management process continues to demonstrate critical non-compliance, with a calculated cost of 140.52, significantly exceeding the critical threshold of 0.3.

Average state durations for `detection` (4d 6h 35min), `activation` (8d 18h 55min), `awaiting` (16d 8h 10min), and `resolution` (5d 22h 11min) are all critically prolonged, and the `resolution` to `closure` transition time (5d 0h 4min) is a notable bottleneck. The Monitor should prioritize investigating the root causes of these specific remaining deviations and prolonged state/transition times."
149,7,"The incident management process exhibits significant compliance issues despite the revised interpretation of repetitive 'detection' and 'awaiting' activities. Critical concerns remain with high numbers of missing 'detection' (319) and 'activation' (544) events, alongside excessive 'repetition' in 'activation' (1990, exceeding 500 acceptable) and 'resolution' (119, exceeding 50 acceptable), and 'mismatch' deviations in 'activation' (115, exceeding 50 acceptable) and 'resolution' (45, exceeding 20 acceptable). Furthermore, average durations for 'detection' (4d 6h 35min), 'activation' (8d 18h 55min), 'awaiting' (16d 8h 10min), and 'resolution' (5d 22h 11min) are critically prolonged, exceeding their non-acceptable thresholds, with the 'resolution' to 'closure' transition also notably slow at 5d 0h 4min. The Monitor should prioritize investigating the root causes of these significant missing activities, persistent uncontrolled repetitions and mismatches, and substantial delays across the core incident lifecycle to improve process adherence."
149,8,"While the re-evaluation acknowledges that repetitive 'detection' (1777) and 'awaiting' (1653) activities are within acceptable thresholds (5000 and 2000 respectively), and 'N*RC' variants (like 'N R C' 182 times) are now considered compliant due to automated merging, critical compliance issues persist. Average durations for 'detection' (4d 6h 35min), 'activation' (8d 18h 55min), 'awaiting' (16d 8h 10min), and 'resolution' (5d 22h 11min) remain critically prolonged, well beyond non-acceptable thresholds, with the 'resolution' to 'closure' transition also notably slow at 5d 0h 4min. Additionally, 'repetition' in 'activation' (1990, exceeding 500) and 'resolution' (119, exceeding 50), and 'mismatch' in 'activation' (115, exceeding 50) and 'resolution' (45, exceeding 20), along with 319 instances of 'missing detection', still indicate severe process non-compliance. The Monitor must prioritize addressing these persistent critical delays and structural deviations in 'activation' and 'resolution' to ensure efficient incident handling."
149,9,"The incident management process exhibits a critical non-compliance cost of 140.04, with severe deviations persisting in key phases. Despite tuned thresholds for repetitive 'detection' (1777) and 'awaiting' (1653) activities and 'N*RC' variants being deemed compliant, average durations for 'detection' (4d 6h 35min), 'activation' (8d 18h 55min), 'awaiting' (16d 8h 10min), and 'resolution' (5d 22h 11min) remain critically prolonged, far exceeding non-acceptable thresholds. Significant contributors to this high cost are 319 missing 'detection' and 544 missing 'activation' activities, compounded by excessive 'activation' repetitions (1990) and mismatches (115), and 'resolution' repetitions (119) and mismatches (45). The Monitor must prioritize investigating these core process bottlenecks and deviation sources in the 'detection', 'activation', and 'resolution' phases to enhance compliance."
149,10,"Despite the exclusion of non-process-harming repetitive 'detection' and 'awaiting' activities, the incident management process still exhibits a critical non-compliance cost of 71.44. Average durations for 'detection' (4d 6h 35min), 'activation' (8d 18h 55min), 'awaiting' (16d 8h 10min), and 'resolution' (5d 22h 11min) remain critically prolonged, significantly exceeding non-acceptable thresholds. Key issues include 319 missing 'detection' and 544 missing 'activation' activities, compounded by 1990 'activation' repetitions and 115 'activation' mismatches, along with 119 'resolution' repetitions and 45 'resolution' mismatches. The Monitor must prioritize investigating the root causes of these persistent delays and structural deviations within the 'detection', 'activation', and 'resolution' phases to enhance compliance."
150,1,"The most frequent recorded variant 'N R C' (182 occurrences), including its repetitive forms like 'N N R C' (81), are now considered compliant due to temporary merge rules that handle multiple detection triggers. However, the 'A R C' variant (135 occurrences), representing the second most frequent flow, remains non-compliant as it bypasses the mandatory 'detection' (N) phase from the reference model. Repetitive 'detection' (1777) and 'awaiting' (1653) activities are within acceptable thresholds and are not considered process errors, aligning with new operational definitions. Remediation is required to address incidents bypassing the initial detection phase, particularly for the 'A R C' variant."
150,2,"The review of common variants, assessed from a Monitor's perspective and considering the updated compliance cost metric and operational definitions, reveals critical non-compliance issues. While the most frequent variant 'N R C' (182 occurrences) and its `N*RC` forms (e.g., 'N N R C' with 81 occurrences) are now compliant due to temporary merge rules and reclassified repetitive 'detection' activities, and repetitive 'awaiting' activities are also exempted, significant deviations persist.

The 'A R C' variant (135 occurrences) and 'R C' (27 occurrences) represent major non-compliant flows, contributing to 319 missing 'Detection' (N) and 544 missing 'Activation' (A) events. These missing activities incur substantial non-compliance costs of 25.52 for missing N and 10.88 for missing A, both critically exceeding the acceptable threshold of `<= 0.05`. Furthermore, 1990 instances of repetitive 'Activation' (A), exemplified by variants like 'N A A R C' (46 occurrences), contribute a critical cost of 79.6, indicating inefficient or erroneous re-activation processes. Mismatch deviations in 'Activation' (115 occurrences, cost 11.5) and 'Resolution' (45 occurrences, cost 5.4) further highlight critical process inconsistencies.

**Required Remediation:**
Focus remediation efforts on addressing the root causes of missing 'Detection' (N) and 'Activation' (A) phases, specifically targeting incidents that initiate directly with 'Activation' (A R C variant) or 'Resolution' (R C variant). Additionally, investigate the high frequency of repetitive 'Activation' activities and 'Mismatch' deviations in 'Activation' and 'Resolution' to identify and correct underlying process failures or automation issues not covered by existing exemptions."
150,3,"As a Monitor, re-evaluation confirms that N*RC variants (e.g., 'N R C' at 182, 'N N R C' at 81) and repetitive 'Detection' (N) and 'Awaiting' (W) activities are compliant due to merge rules and updated definitions. However, critical non-compliance persists with variants like 'A R C' (135 occurrences) and 'R C' (27 occurrences), leading to 319 missing 'Detection' (N) and 544 missing 'Activation' (A), incurring critical costs of 25.52 and 10.88 respectively. Significant critical costs also arise from 1990 repetitive 'Activation' (A) events (cost 79.6), 119 repetitive 'Resolution' (R) events (cost 7.14), 115 'Activation' mismatches (cost 11.5), 45 'Resolution' mismatches (cost 5.4), and 4 'Awaiting' mismatches (cost 0.32). Remediation should prioritize addressing the root causes of missing 'Detection' and 'Activation' activities and the high frequencies of repetitive 'Activation'/'Resolution' and mismatch deviations."
150,4,"As a Monitor, re-evaluation with updated compliance rules confirms that `N R C` (182 occurrences) and `N N R C` (81 occurrences) variants are compliant due to merge rules, and repetitive 'Detection' (N) and 'Awaiting' (W) activities are exempt as non-process errors. However, critical non-compliance persists with variants like `A R C` (135) and `R C` (27), indicating 319 missing 'Detection' activities (cost 25.52) and 544 missing 'Activation' activities (cost 10.88). Additionally, 1990 repetitive 'Activation' (A) events (cost 79.6) and 115 'Activation' mismatches (cost 11.5) remain significant issues. The total non-compliance cost is 140.42, classified as critical, primarily driven by missing `Detection`/`Activation` and repetitive/mismatch `Activation` activities. Remediation should prioritize investigating root causes for missing 'Detection' and 'Activation' in non-exempt cases and addressing the high frequency of repetitive and mismatch deviations within the 'Activation' phase."
150,5,"The most frequent variants are `N R C` (182), `A R C` (135), `N N R C` (81), and `N A R C` (59). Based on updated compliance rules, `N R C` and `N N R C` variants are now considered compliant due to merge rules and exempted repetitive 'Detection' activities. `N A R C` is a standard, compliant process flow. However, the `A R C` variant (135 incidents) highlights a critical process gap with 319 missing 'Detection' activities.

The recalculated total non-compliance cost is 140.9, which is classified as 'critical' according to the environment variables. The primary drivers for this critical non-compliance are 1990 repetitive 'Activation' (A) events (cost 79.6) and 115 'Activation' mismatches (cost 11.5).

**Recommendation:** Investigate the root causes for the consistently missing 'Detection' activities in variants such as `A R C`, and specifically address the high frequency of repetitive and mismatched 'Activation' activities to improve overall process compliance."
150,6,"The most frequent variants, `N R C` (182), `N N R C` (81), and `N N N R C` (49), are now deemed compliant due to temporary merge rules, and repetitive 'Detection' and 'Awaiting' activities are exempted. Despite these adjustments, the overall non-compliance cost remains critical at 140.9. This is primarily driven by 319 missing 'Detection' activities, exemplified by the `A R C` (135 incidents) and `R C` (27 incidents) variants, and 1990 repetitive 'Activation' activities (cost 79.6) alongside 115 'Activation' mismatches (cost 11.5). The Monitor should focus on understanding and remediating the root causes for incidents bypassing the detection phase and the persistent issues of repetitive or mismatched 'Activation' activities."
150,7,"Despite adjustments classifying `N*RC` variants (e.g., `N R C` (182), `N N R C` (81)) as compliant and disregarding repetitive 'Detection' and 'Awaiting' activities, the overall non-compliance cost remains critical at 140.9. The most frequent concerning variants are `A R C` (135 incidents) and `R C` (27 incidents), indicating a significant issue of 319 missing 'Detection' activities (cost 25.52). The primary cost driver is 1990 repetitive 'Activation' activities (cost 79.6), frequently seen in variants like `N A A R C` (46), alongside 115 'Activation' mismatches (cost 11.5). The Monitor should prioritize understanding why incidents bypass 'Detection' and the root causes for the high frequency of repetitive or mismatched 'Activation' activities."
150,8,"The most frequent recorded variants are `N R C` (182), `A R C` (135), and `N N R C` (81). While `N R C` and its variants (e.g., `N N R C`, `N A R C`, `N N A R C`) are now considered compliant due to merge rules and acceptable repetitive 'Detection' activities, `A R C` (135 incidents) reveals a major compliance gap, indicating incidents bypass formal 'Detection'. Similarly, `R C` (27 incidents) shows a critical failure to record both 'Detection' and 'Activation'. Furthermore, variants like `N A A R C` (46) and `A A R C` (38) highlight a significant issue with repetitive 'Activation' activities, which is a primary driver of non-compliance cost.

**Recommendation:** The Monitor should immediately investigate the processes leading to incidents starting directly with 'Activation' (`A R C`) or 'Resolution' (`R C`), as these represent fundamental omissions in initial process steps. Concurrently, a deep dive into the root causes of repetitive 'Activation' (A) activities, frequently observed in variants like `N A A R C`, is required to address this high-cost deviation."
150,9,"The most frequent recorded variants of concern are `A R C` (135 incidents), `N A A R C` (46 incidents), and `R C` (27 incidents), after accounting for acceptable `N*RC` variants due to merge rules and high `N*N` and `W*W` repetitions not reflecting process errors. `A R C` and `R C` variants show critical omissions of 'Detection' and 'Activation' steps respectively, directly bypassing essential initial phases. Repetitive 'Activation' in variants like `N A A R C` and `A A R C` is a major compliance issue, as the 1990 recorded 'A' repetitions significantly exceed the acceptable threshold of 500, contributing substantially to non-compliance costs. The Monitor should immediately investigate the causes for incidents skipping initial 'Detection' and 'Activation' and the reasons behind the excessive repetitive 'Activation' activities."
150,10,"The most frequent problematic variants causing high non-compliance costs are `A R C` (135 incidents), `N A A R C` (46 incidents), and `R C` (27 incidents), after accounting for acceptable `N*RC`, repetitive `N`, and repetitive `W` variants. `A R C` and `R C` indicate critical omissions of 'Detection' and 'Activation' steps respectively, leading to significant missing non-compliance costs (e.g., `0.08` for missing 'N'). Repetitive 'Activation' (A) in `N A A R C` and `A A R C` is a significant compliance issue, as 1990 'A' repetitions far exceed the acceptable threshold of 500, contributing substantially to non-compliance cost (0.04 per repetition). The Monitor should investigate the causes for incidents bypassing initial 'Detection' and 'Activation' phases and the root cause of the excessive 'Activation' repetitions."
151,1,"Based on the updated non-compliance cost metric, all process activities (Detection: 0.02, Activation: 0.02, Awaiting: 0.0, Resolution: 0.0, Closure: 0.0) fall within the 'low' severity level (>= 0.0 AND < 0.1) and are below the acceptable threshold of `<= 0.05`. This indicates excellent compliance across all activities under the new metric. The previous concerns about high deviation counts are mitigated by reclassifying certain repetitions in Detection and Awaiting, and the N*RC variant, as non-process errors. Therefore, no immediate remediation is required regarding average compliance per activity."
151,2,"The average non-compliance cost for all activities (Detection: 0.02, Activation: 0.02, Awaiting: 0.0, Resolution: 0.0, Closure: 0.0) falls within the 'low' severity level (>= 0.0 AND < 0.1). All activities are well below the acceptable compliance threshold of `<= 0.05`. This reflects excellent process compliance, as repetitive deviations in Detection and Awaiting, and the N*RC variant, are appropriately reclassified as non-process errors. No immediate remediation is required for the average compliance per activity."
151,3,"The average non-compliance costs for all activities are: Detection (N): 0.02, Activation (A): 0.02, Awaiting (W): 0.0, Resolution (R): 0.0, and Closure (C): 0.0. All these values fall within the 'low' severity level (>= 0.0 AND < 0.1) and are well below the acceptable compliance threshold of <= 0.05. The reclassification of repetitive Detection and Awaiting deviations, and the N*RC variant (missing Activation), as non-process errors is appropriately reflected in these low costs. Therefore, process compliance for all activities is excellent. No remediation is currently required for average compliance per activity."
151,4,
151,5,
151,6,
151,7,
151,8,"The average non-compliance cost for all activities (Detection: 0.02, Activation: 0.02, Awaiting: 0.0, Resolution: 0.0, Closure: 0.0) is well below the acceptable compliance cost threshold of 0.05, indicating a high level of compliance. The presence of 1777 repetitive detection deviations and 544 missing activation deviations (likely due to N*RC variants) are explicitly considered non-process errors for Responders, which means the actual process non-compliance is even lower than the reported averages. Similarly, 1653 repetitive awaiting activities are not process-harming.

**Recommendation:** The current incident management compliance, as measured by the average non-compliance cost per activity, is excellent for the Responder role. No immediate remediation is required for compliance based on these metrics and interpretations. Further analysis of the temporal development of these costs would be beneficial to proactively identify any negative trends."
151,9,"The average non-compliance costs per activity (Detection: 0.02, Activation: 0.02, Awaiting: 0.0, Resolution: 0.0, Closure: 0.0) are all within the acceptable threshold of <= 0.05, indicating strong process compliance for the Responder role. The high counts of repetitive detection deviations, missing activation due to N\*RC merges, and repetitive awaiting activities are explicitly considered non-process errors and not attributable to Responder actions, reinforcing this positive assessment.

152,1,"The average durations for Detection (6155 min), Activation (12655 min), Awaiting (23530 min), and Resolution (8531 min) are all critically high, significantly exceeding their respective non-acceptable time thresholds (Detection: >2880 min, Activation: >7200 min, Awaiting: >14400 min, Resolution: >4320 min). These prolonged durations clearly indicate efficiency impediments within the incident management process. While the calculated compliance cost values for all activities are low (0.0-0.02, indicating low severity for recorded deviations), and specific repetitive deviations for detection and awaiting, along with N*RC variants, are no longer considered process harming from the Responder's perspective, these low costs do not negate the fundamental inefficiency highlighted by the excessive time spent in these activities.

**Recommendation:** Responders must still focus on reducing the average durations for Detection, Activation, Awaiting, and Resolution. Investigate underlying causes of these extended durations, such as resource availability, task complexity, or external dependencies, separate from the re-categorized deviation types. Prioritize optimizing workflows to bring activity durations within acceptable limits, particularly for the 'Awaiting' state which shows the longest duration."
