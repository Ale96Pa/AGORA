Now please reevaluate the current security control but be aware that certain tunings to the global compliance 
configuration (environment variables) as well as explanation here have been provided. 
Please only consider those if there is a direct applicability to the security control or the previous assessment. 
First of all the applied compliance metric has been changed to non-compliance cost (cost) and the cost model with weights 
per activity and costs per deviation type are provided within cost_function. Furthermore, repetitive detection deviations 
do not reflect process errors but multiple triggers for the same technical activity such as mass service installs for the 
same executable for example triggered by the same source user. Therefore, these repetitions can be considered handled in 
a different case but the trigger occurred multiple times on multiple hosts. The threshold for those repetitive deviations of 
detection has been tuned. Next, the N*RC variant (Detection (potentially multiple)-Resolution-Closure) is caused by temporary 
merge rules, where for a specific incident as soon as there are new triggers, those are automatically merged to a leading case.
No operator was manually involved or assigned to the merged incidents. Therefore, there is no error in the actual process and 
those variants do not require further attention. Last, repetitive awaiting activities relate to incidents assigned to a 
customer or third party side, where the actual security operators cannot take influence in incident handling. 
These repetitive process deviations occur after resubmission times were exceeded and the incident was not 
assigned back to the SOC operators or has been resolved. These cannot be considered as process harming deviations 
since these are not in the security operator control. The threshold for repetitive awaiting activities has been tuned accordingly.
