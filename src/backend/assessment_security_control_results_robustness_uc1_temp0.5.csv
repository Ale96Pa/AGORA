148,1,"The incident management process demonstrates moderate compliance with a fitness score of 0.69, indicating significant deviations from the reference model. A critical concern is the low SLA achievement, with only 44.43% of incidents meeting contractual obligations, requiring immediate attention. While active incidents were commendably reduced from 1963 to 451, the average resolution time of approximately 15.14 days is prolonged, and 33.7% of closed incidents were of high or critical severity. Remediation should prioritize investigating the root causes of SLA failures and process deviations to enhance overall compliance and service delivery."
148,2,"The incident management process shows a positive trend in reducing active incidents from 1963 to 451 and closing a significant number of high (323) and critical (216) severity cases during the period. However, overall process fitness is moderate at 0.69, indicating deviations from the reference model, and only 44.43% of incidents met their SLA, highlighting significant failures in contractual obligations. Remediation must focus on identifying root causes for the low SLA achievement and moderate process compliance, implementing targeted process improvements, and clarifying the unusually low number of new incidents (5) reported for the period to ensure data accuracy."
148,3,"The incident management process shows a positive trend with active incidents decreasing from 1963 to 451 within the selected period. However, overall process fitness is moderate at 0.6948, and critically, only 44.43% of incidents met their SLAs, indicating significant non-compliance with contractual obligations. A substantial 33.7% of closed incidents were of high or critical severity. Remediation should prioritize improving process adherence to enhance SLA achievement, particularly for high and critical severity incidents."
148,4,"The incident management process exhibits moderate compliance with an average fitness of 0.69, yet critically fails to meet contractual obligations, with only 44.43% of SLAs being met. While active incidents decreased significantly from 1963 to 451, and 1598 incidents were closed in the period (33.7% of which were high or critical severity), this low SLA adherence is a major concern. Remediation must prioritize investigating and resolving the root causes for frequent SLA breaches, especially for high and critical incidents, to ensure compliance with service agreements."
148,5,"The incident management process exhibits moderate compliance with a fitness score of 0.695. While active incidents significantly decreased from 1963 to 451, and 1598 incidents were closed (including 323 high and 216 critical severity) during the period, only 44.43% of incidents met their SLA, with an average resolution time exceeding 15 days. Remediation is required to investigate the root causes of the low SLA adherence and extended resolution times, particularly for high and critical severity incidents, to meet contractual obligations."
148,6,"The incident management process shows a positive trend with active incidents decreasing from 1963 to 451, and 1598 incidents closed within the period. However, the overall process fitness is moderate at 0.69, indicating room for improvement in adherence to the reference model. A critical concern is the low SLA achievement rate of 44.43%, highlighting significant failures in meeting contractual obligations.

**Required Remediation:**
Prioritize strategic initiatives to improve the SLA achievement rate and reduce the average incident resolution time (approximately 15.14 days), which likely contributes to the poor SLA performance. Investigate the underlying causes for the moderate process fitness and the high proportion (33.7%) of closed incidents with high or critical severity to implement targeted process enhancements and ensure contractual compliance."
148,7,"The incident management process exhibits moderate compliance with a fitness score of 0.695. While active incidents decreased significantly from 1963 to 451, only 5 new incidents were opened, and a concerning 33.73% of the 1598 closed incidents were high or critical severity. A critical issue is that only 44.43% of incidents met their SLA, indicating poor adherence to contractual obligations, with an average resolution time of approximately 15 days. Remediation should prioritize improving SLA adherence, reducing resolution times, and investigating the root causes for the high proportion of severe incidents and the unusually low number of newly opened incidents."
148,8,"The incident management process shows a positive trend in reducing active incidents, decreasing from 1963 to 451 during the period. However, compliance with contractual obligations is critically low, with only 44.43% of incidents meeting their SLA. The overall process fitness is moderate at 0.69, indicating deviations from the reference model, especially concerning the 539 high and critical severity incidents closed. Remediation should focus on identifying and addressing the root causes for the low SLA adherence, particularly for high and critical severity incidents, and improving process compliance to ensure contractual obligations are consistently met."
148,9,"During the period, active incidents significantly decreased from 1963 to 451, with 1598 incidents closed, while only 5 new incidents were opened, indicating effective backlog reduction. However, overall process compliance (fitness) is moderate at 0.69, and a critical concern is that only 44.43% of incidents met their SLA. Remediation must focus on identifying and addressing process deviations and bottlenecks to improve SLA adherence, especially given that 33.7% of closed incidents were of high or critical severity."
148,10,"As Manager, the incident management compliance reveals significant areas for improvement. Only 44.43% of incidents met their SLA, indicating a critical failure in contractual obligations, despite a moderate process fitness of 0.6948. While active incidents decreased substantially from 1963 to 451, the average time to resolve incidents is high at 21807.82 minutes (approx. 15.14 days). Remediation must prioritize identifying and addressing the root causes for the low SLA adherence and long resolution times, and clarify the unusually low number of 5 newly opened incidents reported for the period."
149,1,"The incident management process demonstrates significant non-compliance, with critical deviations in Detection (N), Activation (A), Awaiting (W), and Resolution (R) states, including 319 missing N, 544 missing A, 1990 repetition A, and 115 mismatch A. All core process states (N, A, W, R) critically exceed their non-acceptable average time thresholds (e.g., Awaiting at 23530 min), indicating severe bottlenecks, while common variants like ""N R C"" (182 occurrences) frequently bypass compliant paths. As a Monitor, I recommend investigating the root causes of these deviations and excessive durations, enforcing adherence to the reference model, and potentially re-evaluating its practicality; a comprehensive fitness assessment is not possible due to insufficient data."
149,2,"The incident management process exhibits significant compliance issues, with non-compliant transitions like N->W (avg. 1d, 0h, 45min) and N->R (avg. 2d, 16h, 34min) frequently occurring, directly violating the reference model. High deviation rates are evident, including 544 missing 'activation' events and 1990 repetitions in 'activation', suggesting frequent process skips and loops. Furthermore, the average time spent in the 'awaiting' state is an excessive 16 days, 8 hours, 10 minutes, indicating a critical bottleneck. Remediation should focus on enforcing the defined transitions, investigating the root causes of state skips and repetitions, and optimizing the 'awaiting' state duration."
149,3,"The incident management process exhibits critical non-compliance with the reference model. Key issues include critically high deviations for missing steps (e.g., 544 for 'activation', 319 for 'detection'), state repetitions (e.g., 1990 for 'activation', 1777 for 'detection', 1653 for 'awaiting'), and significant mismatches (e.g., 115 for 'activation', 45 for 'resolution'), all far exceeding acceptable thresholds. Furthermore, average state durations are critically prolonged for 'detection' (4d 6h), 'activation' (8d 18h), 'awaiting' (16d 8h), and 'resolution' (5d 22h).

**Recommendation:**
As a Monitor, I recommend immediate investigation into the root causes of these critical deviations and prolonged state times, especially focusing on the frequent skipping of 'activation' and 'awaiting' (e.g., ""N R C"" variant) and repeated state occurrences. A review of the reference model versus actual practice is needed to determine if the model requires adaptation or if stricter process enforcement and training are necessary to improve compliance and efficiency."
149,4,"The incident management process exhibits significant non-compliance, with the most frequent variant `N R C` (182 incidents) bypassing the mandatory 'activation' state and direct `N->R` and `N->W` transitions violating the reference model. A major bottleneck exists in the 'awaiting' state, averaging over 16 days, alongside high repetition counts in 'detection', 'activation', and 'awaiting' states. Remediation should enforce the `detection -> activation` flow and investigate the root causes for the 'awaiting' state duration and frequent repetitions. To further enhance compliance monitoring, an overall process fitness score is required, as its severity levels are defined but the metric itself is not provided in the current data."
149,5,"The incident management process exhibits critical non-compliance with the reference model. There are alarmingly high rates of missing states (e.g., 319 for 'detection', 544 for 'activation') and state repetitions (e.g., 1777 for 'detection', 1990 for 'activation', 1653 for 'awaiting'), indicating frequent deviations. Average durations for 'detection' (6155 min), 'activation' (12655 min), 'awaiting' (23530 min), and 'resolution' (8531 min) are all significantly above non-acceptable thresholds, highlighting severe bottlenecks. Furthermore, common variants like 'N R C' and 'A R C' bypass mandatory steps, and unmodeled transitions such as 'N->W' and 'N->R' occur, demonstrating a severe lack of process adherence.

**Required Remediation:**
Immediately investigate the root causes of skipped and repeated states, address the excessive time spent in 'detection', 'activation', 'awaiting', and 'resolution', and enforce stricter adherence to the defined incident management reference model to eliminate non-compliant process flows."
149,6,"The incident management process exhibits critical compliance issues. Average durations for detection (6155 min), activation (12655 min), awaiting (23530 min), and resolution (8531 min) significantly exceed non-acceptable thresholds, indicating severe bottlenecks. Furthermore, there are critically high counts of missing (N: 319, A: 544) and repeated (N: 1777, A: 1990, W: 1653) states, alongside frequent non-compliant transitions like N->W and N->R. The prevalence of non-compliant variants such as 'N R C' (182 incidents) and 'A R C' (135 incidents) highlights widespread deviations from the reference model, requiring immediate investigation into process enforcement and efficiency."
149,7,"The incident management process exhibits critical non-compliance, with key states like 'detection', 'activation', 'awaiting', and 'resolution' showing significantly high deviations (e.g., 'activation' has 544 missing, 1990 repetitions, 115 mismatches, all exceeding thresholds) and excessively long average durations (e.g., 'awaiting' at 16d 8h 10min vs. <=5d acceptable). A major inconsistency is the most frequent process variant ""N R C"" (182 occurrences), which directly bypasses the 'activation' state, a path not allowed by the reference model and indicating a fundamental disconnect. Immediate remediation is required to investigate the root causes of these widespread deviations and prolonged state times, enforce adherence to the defined reference model, and ensure process flows align with established standards."
149,8,"As a Monitor, the incident management process exhibits critical non-compliance. Deviations are alarmingly high for 'missing' states (Detection: 319, Activation: 544) and 'repetition' (Detection: 1777, Activation: 1990, Awaiting: 1653, Resolution: 119), significantly exceeding acceptable thresholds. Average state durations, particularly for 'awaiting' (16d, 8h, 10min), are unacceptably long, indicating severe bottlenecks. The prevalence of non-compliant variants like 'N R C' and 'A R C' further highlights a fundamental disconnect from the reference model, requiring immediate investigation and enforcement of process adherence."
149,9,"The incident management process exhibits critical compliance issues. The most frequent incident flow, 'N R C' (182 incidents), and observed transitions like 'N->W' and 'N->R' are non-compliant with the reference model, bypassing required 'activation' steps. Furthermore, average durations for 'detection' (6155 min), 'activation' (12655 min), 'awaiting' (23530 min), and 'resolution' (8531 min) far exceed non-acceptable thresholds, indicating severe bottlenecks. Immediate remediation is required to enforce the defined process model and address the excessive time spent in critical states."
149,10,"The incident management process exhibits critical non-compliance with the reference model. There are severe deviations, including critically high numbers of missing (319 for detection, 544 for activation) and repeated activities (1777 for detection, 1990 for activation, 1653 for awaiting, 119 for resolution), indicating significant process adherence issues. Average durations for detection, activation, awaiting, and resolution states are also critically high, far exceeding non-acceptable thresholds. Remediation is required to investigate the root causes of these deviations and enforce adherence to the defined incident management process, especially concerning the high frequency of non-compliant transitions like 'N R C' and 'N W R C'."
150,1,"The most frequent incident process variants are 'N R C' (182 occurrences), 'A R C' (135 occurrences), and 'N N R C' (81 occurrences). The 'A R C' variant is compliant, representing a direct path from Activation to Resolution. However, 'N R C' and 'N N R C' are non-compliant as the reference model requires 'detection' (N) to transition to 'activation' (A) before reaching 'resolution' (R), and 'N N R C' also shows an unauthorized repetition of the 'detection' state. This indicates a significant compliance issue where incidents frequently bypass the 'activation' and 'awaiting' stages, warranting further investigation into process adherence."
150,2,"The most frequent variants observed are 'N R C' (182 incidents), 'A R C' (135 incidents), 'N N R C' (81 incidents), 'N A R C' (59 incidents), and 'N N N R C' (49 incidents). A significant non-compliance issue is evident in variants 'N R C', 'N N R C', and 'N N N R C', which collectively represent 312 incidents, by directly transitioning from 'Detection (N)' to 'Resolution (R)' and bypassing 'Activation (A)' as required by the reference model. Furthermore, the frequent repetition of 'N' in these variants (e.g., 'N N R C') indicates logging or process adherence issues. It is recommended to investigate why the 'Activation' phase is consistently skipped after 'Detection' and address the root cause of these non-compliant transitions and state repetitions."
150,3,"The most frequent variants are `N R C` (182 incidents), `A R C` (135 incidents), and `N N R C` (81 incidents). The `N R C` and `N N R C` variants are non-compliant as they bypass the 'activation' state and/or involve unmodeled state repetitions (e.g., N->N), indicating a direct jump from detection to resolution. While `A R C` is compliant from activation onwards, its prevalence suggests 'detection' is often not the recorded starting point. The frequent occurrence of state repetitions (e.g., `N N`, `A A`) across many variants highlights potential inconsistencies in process execution or logging that deviate from the linear reference model.

**Recommendation:** Investigate why 'activation' is frequently skipped (N->R) and why states like 'detection' and 'activation' are often repeated, as these are significant deviations from the reference model."
150,4,"The most frequent recorded variant is ""N R C"" (182 incidents), indicating a direct transition from detection to resolution, bypassing the mandatory activation state, which deviates from the reference model. The second most frequent, ""A R C"" (135 incidents), shows incidents starting directly at activation, missing the initial detection phase entirely. These highly frequent non-compliant paths, along with repeated states like in ""N N R C"" (81 incidents), suggest significant inconsistencies in process execution. Remediation is required to investigate why the formal activation step is frequently skipped or why incidents are initiated mid-process, ensuring adherence to the defined `N -> A` or `N -> A -> W` transitions."
150,5,"The most frequent recorded variants are `N R C` (182 occurrences), `A R C` (135 occurrences), and `N N R C` (81 occurrences). The `N R C` variant indicates a direct flow from detection to resolution, bypassing the 'activation' state, while `A R C` suggests incidents are initiated directly at 'activation', implying missing 'detection' records. The `N N R C` variant highlights repeated 'detection' events. These deviations are significant as the compliant `N A R C` path only accounts for 59 occurrences, signaling a need to review and enforce consistent adherence to the formal 'detection' and 'activation' steps in the incident management process."
150,6,"The most frequent recorded variants are 'N R C' (182), 'A R C' (135), and 'N N R C' (81). 'N R C' indicates incidents bypassing the 'activation' state after detection, which is a deviation from the reference model's `N->A` path. 'A R C' suggests incidents are activated without a recorded 'detection' phase, bypassing the model's starting point. 'N N R C' shows repeated 'detection' before skipping 'activation'. These common deviations highlight significant non-compliance in the initial stages of incident management, particularly concerning the 'detection' and 'activation' states.
**Recommendation:** Investigate the reasons behind the frequent bypassing of the 'activation' state and incidents starting directly at 'activation' to ensure adherence to the defined process."
150,7,"The most frequent recorded variant is 'N R C' (182 occurrences), indicating incidents skipping the 'activation' phase to move directly from 'detection' to 'resolution', which is a non-compliant transition according to the reference model. The second most frequent is 'A R C' (135 occurrences), a compliant path where 'awaiting' is skipped. Other common variants like 'N N R C' (81 occurrences) further highlight the non-compliant 'N -> R' transition alongside frequent repetitions in the 'detection' state. As a Monitor, this suggests a significant deviation in the process flow where 'activation' is often bypassed, requiring immediate investigation into why incidents are not being formally activated."
150,8,"The most frequent variants are 'N R C' (182 incidents), 'A R C' (135 incidents), and 'N N R C' (81 incidents). 'N R C' and 'N N R C' represent deviations by skipping 'activation' and 'awaiting' or repeating 'detection', while 'A R C' indicates incidents starting directly at 'activation', bypassing 'detection'. Only 'N A R C' (59 incidents) fully aligns with a compliant path (detection -> activation -> resolution -> closure). As a Monitor, I recommend investigating the root causes for the high frequency of these non-compliant variants, especially the direct N->R transitions and missing 'detection' states, to identify process gaps or logging inconsistencies."
150,9,"The most frequent variants are 'N R C' (182 incidents), 'A R C' (135 incidents), and 'N N R C' (81 incidents). 'N R C' and 'N N R C' indicate a common deviation where the 'activation' state is bypassed after 'detection', which is not a direct path in the reference model. 'A R C' suggests incidents frequently start directly at 'activation', missing the 'detection' phase entirely. The compliant 'N A R C' path (59 incidents), which skips 'awaiting' as permitted, is less common than these non-compliant flows.

**Recommendation:** Investigate why 'detection' and 'activation' states are frequently missed or bypassed, as these patterns represent significant deviations from the defined incident management reference model and are reflected in the high 'missing' deviation counts for 'A' (544) and 'N' (319). Review the processes leading into 'activation' and from 'detection' to ensure adherence or update the model if these are intended shortcuts."
150,10,"The most frequent recorded variant is 'N R C' (182 occurrences), which represents a direct transition from Detection to Resolution, bypassing Activation and Awaiting. This is a significant non-compliant deviation from the reference model, which only allows N->A or A->R. Additionally, variants like 'N N R C' (81 occurrences) and 'N N N R C' (49 occurrences) highlight frequent repetitions of the Detection state, indicating process inefficiencies or logging issues.

**Recommendation:** Investigate the root cause for incidents directly transitioning from Detection to Resolution, bypassing critical intermediate steps. Review incident logging practices to address the high frequency of repeated 'Detection' states and ensure all mandatory states are recorded."
151,1,"The incident management process shows non-compliance in the 'activation' (A) and 'awaiting' (W) activities, with fitness scores of 0.10 and 0.14 respectively, falling below the acceptable threshold of >=0.15. The 'activation' activity is significantly impeded by high repetitions (1990) and missing steps (544). The 'awaiting' activity, with the longest average duration (16d, 8h, 10min) and substantial repetitions (1653), indicates bottlenecks. Remediation should focus on streamlining the 'activation' process to reduce deviations and investigating root causes for incidents lingering or re-entering the 'awaiting' state."
151,2,"The incident management process shows significant compliance issues with the 'fitness' metric for several activities. Specifically, 'Activation' (average fitness 0.1) and 'Awaiting' (average fitness 0.14) fall below the acceptable threshold of >= 0.15. This non-compliance is primarily driven by critically high deviations in 'Activation' (missing: 544, repetition: 1990, mismatch: 115) and excessive repetitions in 'Awaiting' (1653), far exceeding their respective thresholds. Remediation should focus on investigating and resolving the root causes of these high deviation counts in the 'Activation' and 'Awaiting' phases to improve process adherence."
151,3,"The overall average fitness for all activities (0.10-0.17) falls into the 'critical' compliance severity level. Specifically, the 'Activation' (A) and 'Awaiting' (W) activities are non-compliant with their target fitness metrics. 'Activation' has an average fitness of 0.10 (below >=0.15) due to high repetition (1990) and missing (544) deviations, with an average duration of 8d, 18h, 55min (exceeding 7200min). 'Awaiting' has an average fitness of 0.14 (below >=0.15) primarily due to high repetition (1653) and an average duration of 16d, 8h, 10min (exceeding 14400min). Remediation should focus on process streamlining in 'Activation' to reduce missing and repeated steps, and addressing the root causes of extensive repetitions and prolonged durations in 'Awaiting'."
151,4, "The incident management process shows critical non-compliance across all activities except closure, with average fitness values ranging from 0.10 to 0.17. The 'activation' activity is a primary impediment, displaying the highest number of missing (544), repetition (1990), and mismatch (115) deviations, alongside a non-acceptable average duration of 8 days, 18 hours, 55 minutes. Additionally, the 'awaiting' activity has the longest non-acceptable average duration (16 days, 8 hours, 10 minutes) and high repetition deviations (1653). Remediation should prioritize a comprehensive review of the 'activation' and 'awaiting' processes to identify root causes for these critical deviations and excessive durations."
151,5,"The average fitness for 'Activation' (0.10) and 'Awaiting' (0.14) activities is below the acceptable compliance threshold of >= 0.15, indicating non-compliance. The 'Activation' activity shows significant deviations with 544 missing, 1990 repetition, and 115 mismatch instances, while 'Awaiting' has a high 1653 repetitions. Remediation is required to investigate the root causes for these deviations in 'Activation' and 'Awaiting' process steps. Implement stricter controls or training to improve adherence and bring fitness scores within acceptable limits."
151,6,"The average fitness for all activities (Detection: 0.11, Activation: 0.1, Awaiting: 0.14, Resolution: 0.17, Closure: 0.17) falls into the 'critical' severity range (<=0.5). Specifically, 'Activation' (0.1) and 'Awaiting' (0.14) are below their acceptable fitness threshold (>=0.15). Furthermore, 'Detection' (319 missing, 1777 repetition), 'Activation' (544 missing, 1990 repetition, 115 mismatch), 'Awaiting' (1653 repetition), and 'Resolution' (119 repetition, 45 mismatch) exhibit critical levels of deviations, significantly impeding process compliance. Remediation should focus on root cause analysis for these high deviation counts and improving adherence to the defined process steps within these activities."
151,7,"The incident management process shows non-compliance in the 'activation' (A) and 'awaiting' (W) activities. 'Activation' has an average fitness of 0.1, falling below the acceptable threshold of >=0.15, with 544 missing and 1990 repetition deviations. 'Awaiting' also has an average fitness of 0.14, below the >=0.15 threshold, characterized by 1653 repetition deviations and an excessive average duration of 16 days, 8 hours, and 10 minutes. Remediation should focus on streamlining activation procedures to reduce missing and repeated steps, and critically, investigate and resolve bottlenecks in the 'awaiting' phase to decrease repetitions and drastically shorten its duration."
151,8,"The average fitness compliance for all incident management activities (0.10 to 0.17) falls within the "critical" severity level. Specifically, the 'Activation' (0.1) and 'Awaiting' (0.14) activities are non-compliant, failing to meet their individual acceptable fitness threshold of >= 0.15. 'Activation' is the most impeding activity, showing the highest number of missing (544), repetition (1990), and mismatch (115) deviations. 'Awaiting' also exhibits high repetition (1653). **Required Remediation:** Focus remediation efforts on the 'Activation' and 'Awaiting' activities. For 'Activation', clarify process triggers and completion criteria to reduce missing and repetition deviations, and review standard operating procedures to address mismatches. For 'Awaiting', investigate the causes of high repetition, such as unclear ownership or inefficient hand-off procedures, to streamline the process."
151,9,"Incident management compliance is below acceptable levels for the 'activation' and 'awaiting' activities, with average fitness values of 0.1 and 0.14 respectively, both below the 0.15 threshold. The 'activation' activity shows high deviations across missing (544), repetition (1990), and mismatch (115) types. The 'awaiting' activity is primarily affected by a high number of repetitions (1653). Remediation is required to review and streamline the 'activation' and 'awaiting' processes to reduce these deviations, possibly through enhanced training or process automation for responders."
151,10,"The incident management process shows critical compliance deficiencies. The 'activation' (0.1) and 'awaiting' (0.14) activities fall below their acceptable fitness threshold of >= 0.15. Furthermore, 'detection' (6035 min), 'activation' (12655 min), 'awaiting' (23530 min), and 'resolution' (8531 min) activities all exceed their non-acceptable time thresholds.

**Required Remediation:**
Focus remediation on:
1.  **Reducing repetitions:** Address the high number of repetitions in 'detection' (1777), 'activation' (1990), and 'awaiting' (1653).
2.  **Addressing missing steps:** Investigate and rectify the frequent missing steps in 'detection' (319) and 'activation' (544).
3.  **Streamlining processes:** Implement measures to significantly reduce the excessive average time spent in 'detection', 'activation', 'awaiting', and 'resolution' to meet acceptable time limits."
152,1,"The average durations for Detection (4d 6h 35min), Activation (8d 18h 55min), Awaiting (16d 8h 10min), and Resolution (5d 22h 11min) are all significantly above their respective non-acceptable time thresholds. The ""awaiting"" state is the most critical bottleneck. Remediation requires a detailed review of the workflows and resources allocated to these activities to identify root causes for delays. Implement process improvements, potentially including automation or increased staffing, to reduce these excessive durations and improve overall process efficiency."
152,2,"The average activity durations reveal significant process inefficiencies, with 'detection' (6155 min), 'activation' (12655 min), 'awaiting' (23530 min), and 'resolution' (8531 min) all critically exceeding their respective non-acceptable time thresholds (2880, 7200, 14400, and 4320 minutes). The 'awaiting' state is the most significant bottleneck. Remediation is required to investigate the root causes of these prolonged durations and implement targeted process improvements or resource adjustments to enhance efficiency in these critical phases."
152,3,"The average durations for Detection (4d, 6h, 35min), Activation (8d, 18h, 55min), Awaiting (16d, 8h, 10min), and Resolution (5d, 22h, 11min) are critically above their respective non-acceptable thresholds (2880min, 7200min, 14400min, and 4320min). The ""awaiting"" state is the most significant impediment to efficiency.

**Remediation:** Immediately investigate the root causes of these critically prolonged durations, especially for the ""awaiting"" and ""activation"" states, which are significantly exceeding acceptable limits. Focus on streamlining workflows, re-evaluating resource allocation, or revising process steps to drastically reduce these activity times and improve overall incident management efficiency."
152,4,"The average durations for Detection (4d 6h), Activation (8d 19h), Awaiting (16d 8h), and Resolution (5d 22h) significantly exceed their acceptable time limits (1d, 3d, 5d, 2d respectively), indicating severe process inefficiency. All activities exhibit critically low fitness scores (0.10-0.17), with Detection and Activation showing high numbers of missing (319, 544) and repeated (1777, 1990) steps. Remediation must focus on streamlining Detection, Activation, and Awaiting to reduce these deviations, thereby improving efficiency and drastically cutting activity durations."
152,5,"The incident management process is non-compliant in 'Activation' (0.1 fitness) and 'Awaiting' (0.14 fitness), both falling below the acceptable 0.15 threshold. All activities except 'Closure' significantly exceed their acceptable average time limits (e.g., 'Detection' at 4d 6h 35min vs. <=1d, 'Awaiting' at 16d 8h 10min vs. <=5d). Critically high deviations in 'missing' (Detection: 319, Activation: 544), 'repetition' (Detection: 1777, Activation: 1990, Awaiting: 1653, Resolution: 119), and 'mismatch' (Activation: 115, Resolution: 45) indicate severe process adherence issues. Remediation requires immediate process re-evaluation and enforcement in these areas to improve compliance and efficiency."
152,6,"The average durations for the 'Awaiting' (16d, 8h, 10min), 'Activation' (8d, 18h, 55min), 'Resolution' (5d, 22h, 11min), and 'Detection' (4d, 6h, 35min) activities critically exceed their acceptable timeframes, severely impeding process efficiency. This is compounded by very low average compliance scores (0.10-0.17, all "critical") and high repetition rates, notably in 'Activation' (1990), 'Detection' (1777), and 'Awaiting' (1653). Remediation requires an urgent, detailed review of these specific workflows to identify and eliminate root causes for excessive durations and frequent re-entry into states, potentially through process re-engineering or automation."
152,7,"The average durations for Detection (4d 6h 35min), Activation (8d 18h 55min), Awaiting (16d 8h 10min), and Resolution (5d 22h 11min) are critically high, significantly exceeding their respective non-acceptable thresholds (2d, 5d, 10d, 3d). Only the Closure activity (0d 0h 40min) falls within acceptable limits. This indicates severe process efficiency impediments across most critical incident management phases.

**Recommendation:** Immediate remediation is required. Responders must thoroughly investigate the root causes for the excessive durations in Detection, Activation, Awaiting, and Resolution activities. Focus should be on identifying specific bottlenecks, resource constraints, or procedural inefficiencies within these phases to implement targeted process improvements and reduce future activity durations."
152,8,"As a Responder, the 'awaiting' (16d, 8h, 10min), 'activation' (8d, 18h, 55min), 'resolution' (5d, 22h, 11min), and 'detection' (4d, 6h, 35min) activities are significantly impeding process efficiency, all vastly exceeding their non-acceptable time thresholds. Notably, 'awaiting' (1653 repetitions) and 'activation' (1990 repetitions, 544 missing) also exhibit high deviation frequencies, suggesting process breakdowns and inefficiencies. Remediation requires investigating root causes for these excessive delays and deviations, focusing on streamlining workflows, improving resource allocation, and enhancing diagnostic capabilities. This will help reduce activity durations and improve overall incident management compliance."
152,9, "The average durations for Detection (4d, 6h, 35min), Activation (8d, 18h, 55min), Awaiting (16d, 8h, 10min), and Resolution (5d, 22h, 11min) are all significantly above their respective non-acceptable time thresholds (2880 min, 7200 min, 14400 min, and 4320 min). The 'Awaiting' state represents the most severe bottleneck, taking over 16 days on average. **Recommendation:** A comprehensive root cause analysis is immediately required for the 'Awaiting' state to identify specific dependencies, resource constraints, or process inefficiencies causing these prolonged delays. Additionally, investigate the 'Detection', 'Activation', and 'Resolution' phases to streamline initial incident handling, resource allocation, and troubleshooting processes. Implement targeted process improvements and consider automation for initial triage to reduce these critical activity durations."
152,10,"The average durations for Detection (4d, 6h, 35min), Activation (8d, 18h, 55min), Awaiting (16d, 8h, 10min), and Resolution (5d, 22h, 11min) are all significantly above their respective non-acceptable thresholds (2880, 7200, 14400, and 4320 minutes). The 'awaiting' state is the most critical bottleneck. To improve efficiency, remediation must focus on investigating and streamlining the activities within these states, particularly 'awaiting', to identify and eliminate delays, resource contention, or manual handoffs. Implement process automation for initial steps and ensure adequate staffing or tools are available to reduce the excessive time spent in these key phases."
153,1,"**Recommendation and Required Remediation:**

The assessment identifies 470 incidents as critically non-compliant (fitness <= 0.5), with INC0032450 exhibiting the lowest fitness at 0.19. Technical analysis reveals that a majority (442 incidents) are of moderate impact, urgency, and priority, frequently associated with Symptom 491, Location 204, and Category 46, while many also lack recorded symptoms. This pervasive non-compliance, particularly in the detection and activation phases, risks inconsistent incident handling and delayed resolution. Remediation requires urgent investigation into process deviations for incidents with these specific attributes and immediate improvements in initial logging practices to ensure accurate symptom recording."
153,2,"All listed incidents are critically non-compliant, with fitness values ranging from 0.19 to 0.5. A deep dive into their technical attributes reveals that the majority of these incidents are characterized by an Impact of '2', an Urgency of '2', and a Priority of '3'. The most common locations are '204' and '143', and the most frequent categories are '42' and '46'.

The risk resulting from this non-compliance is that a significant number of incidents, despite being rated with moderate impact and urgency (leading to a priority of 3), are consistently failing to follow the defined incident management process, indicated by their critical fitness scores. This suggests systemic issues in how these specific types of incidents are handled, potentially leading to prolonged resolution times, increased operational disruption, and a higher risk of security breaches escalating.

To resolve this non-compliance, remediation should focus on:
1.  **Process Review for Specific Incident Types:** Investigate the handling procedures for incidents with Impact '2', Urgency '2', and Priority '3', particularly those originating from locations '204' and '143' and falling under categories '42' and '46'.
2.  **Root Cause Analysis of Deviations:** Identify specific steps in the ""detection,"" ""activation,"" ""awaiting,"" ""resolution,"" or ""closure"" phases where these incidents deviate from the reference model (e.g., skipping 'awaiting' when not intended, or repeated steps).
3.  **Training and Awareness:** Provide targeted training to teams responsible for these locations and categories, emphasizing adherence to the defined process for moderate-priority incidents.
4.  **Tooling/Automation Improvements:** Assess if current tools or automation are contributing to process deviations for these attributes and adjust as necessary."
153,3,"As an Analyst, the assessment reveals a significant compliance issue: **all 370 incidents in the selected period (June 2016) are critically non-compliant**, with fitness scores ranging from 0.19 (INC0032450) to 0.5. This widespread non-compliance indicates a severe drift between the theoretical and practical incident management process, posing substantial risks of inefficient handling, delayed resolution, and potential escalation of security incidents.

A deep dive into the technical attributes of these incidents shows that a high proportion of them share common characteristics:
*   **Symptom:** Symptom code 491 is overwhelmingly frequent, followed by a large number of incidents with no recorded symptom (None).
*   **Impact, Urgency, Priority:** The majority of incidents are categorized with Impact 2, Urgency 2, and Priority 3, suggesting that most critical non-compliant incidents are perceived as moderate in severity, yet they still fail to follow the process.
*   **Location:** Location 204 is the most frequent, followed by 143, 161, 108, and 93, indicating potential hotspots for process deviations.
*   **Category:** Category 42, 46, and 26 are the most common, suggesting specific types of incidents or systems where non-compliance is concentrated.

**Recommendation:**
To resolve this critical non-compliance, a detailed root cause analysis is required for incidents exhibiting the most frequent symptom (491) and those occurring at the most common locations (204, 143, 161, 108, 93) and categories (42, 46, 26). Investigate the specific activities within the ""detection"" and ""activation"" phases for these incidents, as the low fitness scores suggest early process deviations. Furthermore, analyze the incidents with `None` symptoms to understand if detection or logging processes are insufficient, contributing to the overall compliance gap."
153,4,"All 487 incidents provided exhibit critical non-compliance, with fitness scores ranging from 0.19 to 0.5, indicating a severe drift between the theoretical and practical incident management process. A deep dive reveals that a significant majority of these critical incidents share common attributes: Impact=2, Urgency=2, and Priority=3, alongside dominant symptoms (e.g., 491, None), locations (e.g., 204, 161, 143, 93, 108), and categories (e.g., 46, 26, 42, 23, 53).

**Recommendation & Remediation:**
Focus remediation efforts on these frequently occurring incident characteristics. Conduct a detailed analysis of the actual process traces for incidents with Impact=2, Urgency=2, and Priority=3 to identify specific points of deviation from the reference model. This will pinpoint whether non-compliance stems from inadequate training, impractical process steps, or tooling limitations, enabling targeted improvements to resolve the critical non-compliance."
153,5,"A deep dive into the provided data reveals that all 411 incidents assessed exhibit critical non-compliance, with fitness values ranging from 0.19 to 0.5, indicating a severe systemic drift from the defined incident management process. A significant portion of these critically non-compliant incidents share common technical attributes, notably Symptom 491, Location 204, and Categories 42, 26, 46, despite most being classified as moderate priority (P3). This widespread non-compliance poses risks of inefficient resolution, increased operational costs, and degraded security posture. Remediation requires a detailed root cause analysis of the lowest-fitness incidents and targeted process re-evaluation and training focused on the identified common attributes and moderate priority incidents to align practical execution with the theoretical model."
153,6,"All listed incidents, starting with INC0032450 (fitness 0.19), exhibit critical non-compliance (fitness <= 0.5), indicating severe deviations from the defined incident management process and posing high risks to effective incident handling. To perform a deep dive and identify specific risks or root causes for these most critical incidents, the provided `technical_analysis` data lacks `incident_id` correlation. Therefore, to improve compliance, future data must link technical attributes directly to individual incident IDs, enabling targeted analysis and remediation of process drift."
153,7,"All 500+ incidents listed are critically non-compliant, with fitness scores ranging from 0.19 (e.g., INC0032450) to 0.5, indicating severe deviations from the reference process model. This poses risks of operational inefficiency, inconsistent incident handling, and potential security gaps due to poor process adherence. A technical deep dive reveals prevalent issues such as frequently missing symptom data (many 'None' values), and common occurrences of Symptom 491, Locations 204, 161, 143, 93, 108, 51, and Categories 42, 26, 46, 53, 57, 9, 23.

**Required Remediation:**
Focus on immediate root cause analysis for incidents with Symptom 491 and those originating from Locations 204, 161, 143, 93, 108, 51, and Categories 42, 26, 46, 53, 57, 9, 23. Implement mandatory symptom reporting to address data quality issues and review the incident management process, especially for the high volume of moderate priority incidents (Impact=2, Urgency=2, Priority=3), to reduce the significant drift between theoretical and practical execution."
153,8,"All listed incidents exhibit critical non-compliance, with fitness scores ranging from 0.19 (INC0032450) to 0.5, indicating severe deviations from the defined incident management process. This poses risks of delayed resolution, increased impact, operational inefficiency, and potential regulatory non-compliance. A deep dive into the technical attributes reveals that the majority of these critical incidents share common characteristics: Impact 2, Urgency 2, and Priority 3, frequently originating from locations 204, 161, 143 and belonging to categories 46, 26, 42. Remediation requires analyzing the detailed process traces of these specific incident types to pinpoint exact deviations and identify root causes for the drift between theoretical and practical processes."
153,9,"The incident management process shows critical non-compliance, with all assessed incidents having fitness scores between 0.19 and 0.50, indicating significant deviations from the reference model. A deep dive reveals that many non-compliant incidents share common characteristics, predominantly Impact 2, Urgency 2, and Priority 3, with frequent occurrences of Symptom 491, Location 204, and Categories 42, 26, 46, and 53. This suggests systemic process drift concentrated in specific incident types and attributes. Remediation requires analyzing process logs for these common incidents to identify root causes (e.g., training gaps or unclear procedures) and implementing targeted process adjustments to improve compliance."
153,10,"The assessment reveals that all provided incidents exhibit **critical non-compliance** with the defined incident management process, as their fitness scores range from 0.19 to 0.5, falling within the `>= 0 AND <= 0.5` critical threshold. A significant majority (440 out of 468) of these critically non-compliant incidents share common characteristics: `Impact: 2`, `Urgency: 2`, and `Priority: 3`. The most prevalent attributes among these incidents are `Symptom: 491` (220 occurrences), `Location: 204` (139 occurrences), and `Category: 46` (100 occurrences).

The primary risk is a **systemic failure** in adhering to the incident management process, even for moderately impactful incidents, leading to unpredictable resolution paths, potential delays, and a lack of control over security incident handling. This widespread non-compliance can result in prolonged exposure to threats, increased operational costs, and a diminished ability to effectively respond to security events.

**Required Remediation (Output for Insufficient Data):**
To address this, a deep dive into the actual process traces (event logs) of these critical incidents is essential. The current data lacks the specific sequences of states for individual incidents, which prevents identifying precise process deviations (e.g., skipped steps like 'awaiting', direct jumps from 'activation' to 'closure', or loops). Therefore, the next step must be to **obtain and analyze the full event logs for incidents with `Symptom: 491`, `Location: 204`, and `Category: 46` that have `Impact: 2`, `Urgency: 2`, and `Priority: 3`** to pinpoint the exact ""drift between theoretical and practical process"" and determine if specific activities are consistently misexecuted or omitted. This will enable targeted training, process re-engineering, or tool adjustments to improve compliance."
154,1,"The incident management compliance is critical, as all provided incidents exhibit fitness scores between 0.19 and 0.5, falling within the defined critical threshold. A detailed technical analysis reveals that the most frequently occurring symptom is '491' (162 instances), with a significant number of incidents (104) having no reported symptom.

**Recommendation:**
Generate a detailed report highlighting these most frequent symptoms, categories, and locations to deduce frequently targeted IT assets and infrastructures.

**Required Remediation:**
Address the data quality issue for 'symptom' where 104 incidents have missing information, as this significantly impedes comprehensive technical analysis and root cause identification required by the Analyst role."
154,5,"The incident management process shows significant compliance issues, with all 500 incidents in the selected period falling into the critical fitness range (0.19 to 0.50), far below the acceptable compliance threshold of >= 0.5. Technical analysis reveals that Symptom 491 is the most frequent (177 occurrences), followed by 'None' symptoms (104 occurrences), indicating a potential lack of detailed initial reporting. Location 204 is the most affected (183 incidents), and Category 46 is the most targeted (107 incidents), suggesting these areas are frequently targeted IT assets requiring immediate attention.

**Recommendation:**
Focus remediation efforts on improving initial incident reporting to reduce 'None' symptoms and conducting a deep-dive analysis into Symptom 491, Location 204, and Category 46 to identify root causes and implement targeted preventative measures. This granular analysis is crucial for the Analyst to address the high process non-compliance."
154,6,"The technical analysis reveals that Symptom 491 is the most frequently occurring (170 instances), followed by 'None' (93 instances), indicating a potential lack of detailed symptom reporting. Category 46 is the most affected (78 instances), with Category 42 (60 instances) and Category 26 (59 instances) also being highly prevalent. Location 204 is the most frequently targeted (153 instances), followed by Location 143 (98 instances) and Location 161 (96 instances).

**Recommendation:**
Investigate the root causes behind the high incidence of Symptom 491, Category 46, and Location 204 to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in these frequently targeted IT assets and infrastructures. Implement mandatory and specific symptom reporting to reduce ""None"" entries, improving the quality of technical analysis for future incidents."
154,7,"The incident data reveals that Symptom 491 is the most frequent occurring symptom (180 times), Category 42 is the most affected category (60 times), and Location 204 is the most frequently targeted IT asset/infrastructure (108 times). This indicates a significant concentration of incidents originating from or affecting these specific areas.

**Recommendation:**
As an Analyst, focus on conducting a deeper root cause analysis for incidents linked to Symptom 491, Category 42, and Location 204. Investigate the underlying reasons for their high frequency to identify systemic vulnerabilities or operational issues. Prioritize remediation efforts for these areas to improve overall incident management compliance and reduce frequently targeted IT assets."
154,8,"The technical analysis reveals critical areas for incident management improvement. Symptom '491' is the most prevalent (150 instances), but a significant 75 incidents lack symptom data, indicating a major gap in reporting.
