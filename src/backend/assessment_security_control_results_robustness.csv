148,1,"The incident management process currently exhibits moderate overall compliance with an average fitness of 0.6948. However, a critically low SLA attainment rate of 44.43% reveals significant failures in meeting contractual obligations. While active incidents decreased positively from 1963 to 451, a substantial portion of the 1598 closed incidents show poor compliance, with 323 classified as High and 216 as Critical severity. Immediate remediation is required to improve SLA adherence and process compliance for these high and critical severity incidents. Additionally, the reported opening of only 5 new incidents during the period, contrasting sharply with the volume of active and closed cases, necessitates an investigation into data accuracy for incident creation."
148,2,"The incident management process shows moderate compliance with an average fitness of 0.69. While active incidents decreased significantly from 1963 to 451, and 1598 incidents were closed (33.7% of which were high or critical severity), a critical concern is that only 44.43% of incidents met their SLA. Remediation must prioritize investigating the root causes for the low SLA adherence and the exceptionally high average resolution time of 21807.82 minutes to ensure contractual obligations are met."
148,3,"The incident management process shows moderate compliance with an average fitness of 0.69, falling within the `>= 0.65 AND < 0.85` range. However, a significant concern is the low SLA adherence, with only 44.43% of incidents meeting their contractual obligations, despite a positive trend of active incidents decreasing from 1963 to 451 within the period. The closure of 323 high and 216 critical severity incidents, along with an average resolution time of approximately 15 days, suggests a need to investigate the reasons for SLA non-compliance, particularly for higher-severity incidents, to improve service delivery and meet contractual commitments."
148,4,"The incident management process exhibits a concerningly low SLA adherence of 44.43%, despite achieving a moderate average process fitness of 0.69 during the period. Of the 1598 incidents closed, a significant 33.7% (540 incidents) were classified with high or critical process compliance severity, indicating substantial deviations from the reference model for these cases. While the number of active incidents decreased from 1963 to 451, immediate remediation is required to investigate the root causes of the low SLA achievement and improve compliance, especially for incidents with high and critical severities."
148,5,"During the period, active incidents significantly decreased from 1963 to 451, with 5 new incidents opened and 1598 incidents closed. The overall process compliance is moderate at 0.69 (within the 0.65-0.85 range), but a critical issue is that only 44.43% of incidents met their SLA, indicating a significant breach of contractual obligations. Among the closed incidents, 497 were low, 562 moderate, 323 high, and 216 critical in severity. Immediate remediation is required to improve SLA adherence, particularly for high and critical severity incidents, and to elevate process compliance above the moderate level."
148,6,"The incident management compliance indicates significant issues for management oversight. Only 44.43% of incidents met SLA requirements, directly signaling a failure in meeting contractual obligations. While active incidents decreased from 1963 to 451 during the period, the average process fitness of 0.69 is only at a moderate compliance level, highlighting notable deviations from the defined reference model. Remediation efforts should prioritize improving SLA adherence and investigating the causes for moderate process compliance and the lengthy average time to resolve incidents (over 15 days)."
148,7,"For the selected period, incident management shows a net decrease in active incidents from 1963 to 451, with only 5 new incidents recorded and 1598 incidents closed, categorized primarily as moderate (562) and low (497) severity. However, contractual obligations are severely unmet, as only 44.43% of incidents adhered to their SLA, and overall process fitness is moderate at 0.6948. Remediation is critically needed to investigate the root causes of low SLA performance and moderate process deviations to ensure compliance with policies and contractual commitments."
148,8,"The incident management process demonstrates moderate compliance (fitness 0.69), but critically underperforms on contractual obligations with only 44.43% of SLAs met and an average resolution time exceeding 15 days (21807.82 minutes). A significant concern is that 0% of incidents were resolved by the assigned person, pointing to severe handoff issues, while 33.7% of closed incidents were of high or critical severity. Remediation must prioritize investigating and improving SLA attainment and reducing the average time to resolve by addressing process bottlenecks and ensuring better incident ownership. Additionally, clarify the 'opened incidents' metric for accurate new incident tracking within the reporting period, as only 5 new incidents are recorded against 1598 closed incidents."
148,9,"The incident management compliance shows a moderate process fitness of 0.69, which is acceptable but leaves room for improvement. However, a critical concern is the low SLA adherence rate of only 44.43%, indicating that most incidents are not resolved within contractual obligations, with an average resolution time of approximately 15 days. Additionally, 33.7% of all incidents closed in the period (539 out of 1598) were of high or critical severity. Remediation must focus on identifying and resolving bottlenecks in the process that lead to prolonged resolution times, especially for high and critical incidents, to significantly improve SLA compliance."
148,10,"For the reporting period, incident management shows a **moderate process fitness of 0.69**, indicating reasonable but improvable adherence to the reference model. A critical concern is the **low SLA achievement rate of 44.43%**, directly impacted by the **high average time to resolve incidents (21807.82 minutes or ~15.14 days)**. While only 5 new incidents were opened, active incidents significantly reduced from 1963 to 451, and 1598 incidents were closed, including 216 critical ones. Remediation should prioritize initiatives to analyze and optimize the resolution phase, particularly for moderate and critical incidents, to improve both process fitness and meet contractual SLA obligations."
149,1,"The incident management process demonstrates significant non-compliance, with states like Detection, Activation, and Awaiting exhibiting excessive repetitions (1777, 1990, and 1653 respectively) and average durations (e.g., Awaiting at 16d, 8h, 10min) that far exceed non-acceptable thresholds. Critical deviations also include frequent missing 'Detection' (319) and 'Activation' (544) states, alongside invalid transitions such as N->W and N->R, bypassing the 'activation' state as seen in common variants like ""N R C"" (182 occurrences).

**Required Remediation:**
Investigate the root causes for the widespread process deviations, particularly frequent state repetitions, unauthorized state skips (like N->W and N->R), and implement measures to reduce the excessive average durations across all states except closure. Focus on enforcing adherence to the defined reference model to improve overall compliance."
149,2,"The incident management process shows significant non-compliance with the defined reference model. Notably, unauthorized transitions from 'detection' (N) to 'resolution' (R, avg 2d 16h 34min) and 'awaiting' (W, avg 1d 0h 45min) occur frequently, as these paths are not allowed by the PNML model. High repetition counts in 'detection' (1777), 'activation' (1990), and 'awaiting' (1653), alongside numerous missing 'activation' activities (544 instances), indicate substantial process deviations. Furthermore, the 'awaiting' state exhibits an exceptionally long average duration of 16 days, 8 hours, 10 minutes, and the 'resolution' to 'closure' transition averages 5 days, 0 hours, 4 minutes, highlighting significant bottlenecks. Remediation is required to enforce adherence to the sequential process flow (N->A) and to investigate and optimize the prolonged durations and frequent repetitions in specific states."
149,3,"The incident management process exhibits significant compliance issues with the reference model. Most notably, non-compliant transitions from 'detection' (N) directly to 'resolution' (R) and 'awaiting' (W) are prevalent, as seen with the top variant ""N R C"" occurring 182 times, which deviates from the required N->A path. Additionally, there are very high rates of state repetition for 'detection' (1777), 'activation' (1990), and 'awaiting' (1653), indicating frequent unmodeled loops in the process. Actionable remediation is required to enforce the defined `N->A` transition and investigate the causes of state repetitions and the excessive 16-day average duration for the 'awaiting' state."
149,4,"The incident management process exhibits severe compliance issues. The average durations for 'detection' (4d 6h 35min), 'activation' (8d 18h 55min), 'awaiting' (16d 8h 10min), and 'resolution' (5d 22h 11min) all critically exceed their acceptable time thresholds. Process deviations are excessively high for 'repetition' in states N (1777), A (1990), W (1653), and R (119), alongside significant 'missing' (544) and 'mismatch' (115) counts for 'activation'.

**Required Remediation:** Immediate remediation is needed to address the prevalent non-compliant process flows, notably the ""N R C"" variant (182 occurrences) which bypasses critical 'activation' and 'awaiting' stages not permitted by the reference model. Investigate the root causes of these deviations and the prolonged state durations to enforce adherence to the defined incident management reference model and improve overall process efficiency."
149,5,"The incident management process exhibits critical non-compliance and severe inefficiencies. The pervasive deviations, especially high missing (N: 319, A: 544) and repetition (N: 1777, A: 1990, W: 1653, R: 119) counts, significantly exceed acceptable thresholds, indicating a breakdown in process adherence. Furthermore, average state durations for Detection (6035 min), Activation (12895 min), Awaiting (23530 min), and Resolution (8531 min) critically exceed non-acceptable times (e.g., Detection non-acceptable >= 2880 min), highlighting severe bottlenecks. Remediation is required to enforce process steps and identify root causes for these significant delays and deviations in the detection, activation, awaiting, and resolution phases."
149,6,"The incident management process exhibits critical non-compliance, with deviation counts for `missing` (N: 319, A: 544), `repetition` (N: 1777, A: 1990, W: 1653, R: 119), and `mismatch` (A: 115, R: 45) significantly exceeding acceptable thresholds. The most frequent process variant, 'N R C' (182 occurrences), and recorded `N->W` and `N->R` average transition times directly bypass the 'activation' state, a major deviation from the reference model. Remediation is required to enforce adherence to the defined process flow, ensuring incidents pass through 'activation' (A) and reducing excessive state repetitions. Additionally, the prolonged average duration of 16 days, 8 hours, 10 minutes in the 'awaiting' (W) state should be investigated as a significant bottleneck."
149,7,"The incident management process shows critical compliance issues as the most frequent variant 'N R C' (182 occurrences) indicates a significant unmodeled bypass from 'Detection' (N) to 'Resolution' (R), violating the defined reference model. Average durations for 'Detection' (4d 6h 35min), 'Activation' (8d 18h 55min), 'Awaiting' (16d 8h 10min), and 'Resolution' (5d 22h 11min) critically exceed non-acceptable thresholds, indicating severe bottlenecks. Furthermore, 'missing', 'repetition', and 'mismatch' deviation counts are excessively high for most states (N: 319 missing, 1777 repetition; A: 544 missing, 1990 repetition, 115 mismatch; W: 1653 repetition; R: 119 repetition, 45 mismatch), signaling widespread non-adherence.

**Required Remediation:**
Investigate the prevalent N->R bypass and other unmodeled transitions, urgently address the excessive average durations in Detection, Activation, Awaiting, and Resolution states, and determine the root causes of the critically high deviation counts across multiple process states."
149,8,"The incident management process exhibits severe compliance issues against the reference model. Critical deviations are widespread: detection (N) and activation (A) states show high counts of missing, repetition, and mismatch deviations (e.g., N missing 319 vs. <=20, A repetition 1990 vs. <=500), far exceeding acceptable thresholds. Furthermore, average durations for detection, activation, awaiting, and resolution are critically long, significantly surpassing non-acceptable time limits (e.g., Detection avg. 4d, 6h vs. >=2880min non-acceptable), and non-compliant transitions like 'N->W' and 'N->R' are occurring. Immediate remediation is required to investigate the root causes of these extensive deviations and enforce adherence to the defined process flow, particularly focusing on reducing delays and preventing skipped or repeated activities in the initial phases."
149,9,"The incident management process demonstrates critical non-compliance with the reference model. Average state durations for `detection` (6155 min), `activation` (12655 min), `awaiting` (23530 min), and `resolution` (8531 min) are significantly beyond non-acceptable thresholds. Furthermore, there are pervasive process deviations with high repetitions for `detection` (1777), `activation` (1990), and `awaiting` (1653), and significant mismatches for `activation` (115) and `resolution` (45). Remediation is urgently required to investigate and enforce adherence to defined state transitions (e.g., eliminating observed `N->R` and `N->W` paths), reduce excessive state durations, and ensure incidents consistently follow the full lifecycle from `detection` to prevent skipping initial stages."
149,10,"Based on the Monitor role, the incident management process shows significant compliance issues within the selected period. Average state durations for 'detection', 'activation', 'awaiting', and 'resolution' are critically above their acceptable thresholds, indicating severe process bottlenecks. Furthermore, high counts of 'missing' (N, A), 'repetition' (N, A, R, W), and 'mismatch' (A, R) deviations, alongside unauthorized 'detection' to 'awaiting' (N->W) and 'detection' to 'resolution' (N->R) transitions, highlight frequent non-compliant process executions. Remediation requires immediate investigation into these prolonged state times and the root causes of the widespread process deviations and model violations to enforce adherence."
150,1,"The most frequent recorded variant is ""N R C"" (182 incidents), indicating a critical non-compliance where incidents transition directly from Detection to Resolution, bypassing the required Activation state in the reference model. This suggests a systemic issue in adherence to the defined process. The third most frequent variant, ""N N R C"" (81 incidents), further highlights high repetition in the Detection state (1777 occurrences for 'N') before exhibiting the same non-compliant N->R transition. Remediation requires investigating the operational reasons for skipping activation and enforcing process steps or updating the reference model if this path is an intended, but currently unmodeled, flow."
150,2,"The most frequent recorded variants reveal significant non-compliance, with `N R C` (182 incidents) bypassing the 'activation' and 'awaiting' states, and `A R C` (135 incidents) starting directly at 'activation' without 'detection'. Repetitions of states 'N' (e.g., `N N R C` - 81 incidents) and 'A' (e.g., `N A A R C` - 46 incidents) are also highly common, indicating potential rework or re-evaluation loops. The only fully compliant path among the top variants is `N A R C` (59 incidents), which skips 'awaiting' but follows allowed transitions. A remediation is required to investigate why 'detection', 'activation', and 'awaiting' states are frequently skipped or repeated, suggesting a need for process re-enforcement and user training to align actual incident handling with the reference model's intended flow."
150,3,"As a Monitor, the most frequent recorded incident variants reveal significant deviations from the reference model. The top variant, ""N R C"" (182 occurrences), indicates incidents directly moving from detection to resolution, bypassing activation and awaiting states. Similarly, ""A R C"" (135 occurrences) skips detection entirely, initiating at activation, while ""N N R C"" (81 occurrences) shows repeated detection before resolution, again bypassing activation and awaiting. These patterns are more prevalent than the compliant ""N A R C"" (59 occurrences) and ""N A W R C"" (26 occurrences) paths. Required remediation: Investigate why 'detection', 'activation', and 'awaiting' states are consistently bypassed or repeated in these frequent variants, ensuring process adherence and accurate logging across all incident stages."
150,4,"The most frequent incident management variants are 'N R C' (182 incidents) and 'A R C' (135 incidents), which significantly deviate from the reference model by often skipping the 'activation' and 'awaiting' states. The fully compliant variant 'N A R C' is less frequent with 59 occurrences. This indicates a widespread pattern of non-compliance where critical initial and intermediate process stages are frequently bypassed, necessitating investigation into why incidents are not following the defined 'N -> A -> W -> R -> C' or 'N -> A -> R -> C' paths. Remediation should focus on enforcing the proper inclusion of the 'activation' and 'awaiting' phases in incident workflows to improve process adherence."
150,5,"The most frequent variant, 'N R C' (182 incidents), reveals a significant non-compliance where incidents bypass the 'activation' state, moving directly from 'detection' to 'resolution', which is not allowed by the reference model. This is supported by 544 missing 'activation' events. The second most frequent compliant path is 'A R C' (135 incidents), leveraging the allowed 'activation' to 'resolution' skip. Additionally, variants like 'N N R C' (81 incidents) show frequent repetitions in the 'detection' state (1777 total 'N' repetitions), indicating potential re-evaluation cycles.

**Required Remediation:**
Investigate the root cause for the frequent skipping of the 'activation' state and enforce adherence to the reference model or reassess its suitability. Furthermore, analyze the reasons behind the high number of 'detection' repetitions to identify and resolve underlying process inefficiencies."
150,6,"The most frequent incident variant is 'N R C' (182 occurrences), which deviates from the reference model by skipping the 'activation' (A) state. The second most common variant, 'A R C' (135 occurrences), suggests incidents frequently start at 'activation', potentially missing the 'detection' (N) state, which aligns with 319 missing 'N' events. While 'N A R C' (59 occurrences) is a compliant path, the dominance of non-compliant direct jumps from 'N' to 'R' and high repetitions in 'N' (e.g., 'N N R C' with 81 occurrences) indicates significant process non-conformance. Remediation should focus on enforcing the 'detection' to 'activation' transition and reducing state repetitions."
150,7,"The most frequent recorded variants reveal significant non-compliance, demonstrating major deviations from the reference model. The top variant, 'N R C' (182 incidents), directly skips the mandatory 'activation' phase, indicating a systematic bypass. Additionally, 'A R C' (135 incidents) frequently bypasses the initial 'detection' state, while 'N N R C' (81 incidents) shows unauthorized repetitions in the detection phase. These patterns highlight critical process adherence issues, particularly around the 'detection' and 'activation' states, and require immediate investigation to enforce the defined incident management workflow."
150,8,"The most frequent recorded variants are 'N R C' (182 incidents), 'A R C' (135 incidents), and 'N N R C' (81 incidents). Critically, 'N R C' and 'N N R C' are non-compliant, as they exhibit an N->R transition, bypassing the mandatory 'activation' (A) state required by the reference model after 'detection' (N). The repetition in 'N N R C' also highlights an unmodeled deviation in the detection phase. As a Monitor, it is recommended to investigate the root cause for frequently skipping 'activation' and the high frequency of 'N' state repetitions to ensure process adherence and improve compliance."
150,9,"The most frequent recorded incident variant is 'N R C' (182 incidents), which is non-compliant as it skips the mandatory 'activation' state (A) after 'detection' (N). The second most frequent, 'A R C' (135 incidents), is also non-compliant by bypassing the initial 'detection' state (N). These observations, combined with 544 missing 'activation' and 319 missing 'detection' events, indicate a systemic issue where incidents frequently do not follow the defined process flow, particularly concerning initial stages. Remediation requires investigation into why 'activation' and 'detection' states are often skipped or missing."
150,10,"The most frequent variants, 'N R C' (182 occurrences) and 'A R C' (135 occurrences), are non-compliant with the reference model. 'N R C' indicates a bypass of the 'activation' (A) state after detection, while 'A R C' suggests incidents are initiated directly at 'activation', omitting the 'detection' (N) phase. The fully compliant 'N A R C' variant only represents 59 incidents, demonstrating widespread deviation from the prescribed process flow. This highlights a critical emerging issue in process adherence, further supported by high repetition counts in states N (1777), A (1990), and W (1653) suggesting process inefficiencies or data recording inconsistencies."
151,1,"The incident management process exhibits significant non-compliance, particularly from the Responder's perspective on individual activity performance. The 'activation' (0.1) and 'awaiting' (0.14) activities fall below the acceptable fitness threshold of 0.15, indicating poor conformance. This is corroborated by extremely high repetition counts in 'detection' (1777), 'activation' (1990), and 'awaiting' (1653), and high missing/mismatch deviations in 'detection' (319 missing) and 'activation' (544 missing, 115 mismatch). Furthermore, average times in 'detection' (4d 6h), 'activation' (8d 18h), 'awaiting' (16d 8h), and 'resolution' (5d 22h) far exceed their respective non-acceptable time thresholds (e.g., 'awaiting' is 16 days vs. 10 days non-acceptable), highlighting severe bottlenecks.

**Recommendation:**
Prioritize remediation efforts on the 'activation' and 'awaiting' activities to improve fitness scores to at least 0.15. Immediately investigate the root causes for the excessively high repetition rates across 'detection', 'activation', and 'awaiting', as well as high missing and mismatch deviations, as these are critical impediments to compliance. Implement process optimizations to drastically reduce the average time spent in 'detection', 'activation', 'awaiting', and 'resolution' phases."
151,2,"The 'activation' (A) and 'awaiting' (W) activities are non-compliant, with fitness scores of 0.1 and 0.14 respectively, both below the acceptable threshold of >= 0.15. The low compliance for 'activation' is due to high repetitions (1990), missing steps (544), and mismatches (115). 'Awaiting' also exhibits significant repetitions (1653). To remediate, standardize procedures for 'activation' to reduce deviations across all types, and streamline the 'awaiting' phase to minimize repetitions, ensuring adherence to the reference model."
151,3,"The ""activation"" (A) activity has a critical compliance issue with an average fitness of 0.1, falling below the acceptable threshold of 0.15. This is largely due to high repetition (1990) and missing (544) deviations, and its average duration (8d, 18h, 55min) exceeds the non-acceptable limit (5 days). Similarly, the ""awaiting"" (W) activity is critical with an average fitness of 0.14, below the 0.15 threshold, stemming from very high repetition deviations (1653) and an average duration (16d, 8h, 10min) significantly past the non-acceptable limit (10 days).

**Remediation:** For ""activation"", responders must streamline procedures to reduce repetitions and ensure all steps are completed, actively investigating and resolving underlying causes for these deviations and delays. For ""awaiting"", implement stricter exit criteria and improve coordination with external dependencies or other teams to prevent incidents from repeatedly returning to this state and reduce the excessive time spent."
151,4,"The 'Activation' phase shows critical non-compliance with a fitness of 0.1 (below the >=0.15 threshold) and excessive deviations in missing (544 vs. <=200), repetition (1990 vs. <=500), and mismatch (115 vs. <=50). Additionally, 'Detection' has critically high missing (319 vs. <=20) and repetition (1777 vs. <=500) deviations, and 'Awaiting' has critically high repetition (1653 vs. <=200) deviations with slightly below acceptable fitness (0.14 vs. >=0.15). 'Resolution' also suffers from high repetition (119 vs. <=50) and mismatch (45 vs. <=20) deviations.

**Required Remediation:**
Immediate process clarification and mandatory retraining for responders are needed for the 'Activation' phase. Further investigation into the root causes of high missing and repetition deviations in 'Detection' and 'Awaiting', as well as high repetition and mismatch in 'Resolution', is crucial to streamline workflows and enforce compliance with the reference model."
151,5,"The incident management process exhibits critically low fitness, with all activity averages (0.10 to 0.17) falling into the overall ""critical"" severity range. Specifically, ""Activation"" (0.10) and ""Awaiting"" (0.14) activities fall below their acceptable fitness thresholds (>=0.15), primarily due to extensive repetitions (1990 in Activation, 1653 in Awaiting) and significant missing steps (544 in Activation, 319 in Detection). Furthermore, all activities except ""Closure"" demonstrate critically high average durations, dramatically exceeding non-acceptable time limits (e.g., ""Awaiting"" takes 16d 8h 10min compared to the non-acceptable threshold of >=10 days). Remediation requires an urgent, comprehensive process review to identify root causes for these deviations, implement targeted automation for repetitive tasks, and provide focused training to improve adherence and reduce delays in ""Detection"", ""Activation"", ""Awaiting"", and ""Resolution""."
151,6,"The 'Activation' (0.10 fitness) and 'Awaiting' (0.14 fitness) activities show critically low average fitness, falling below the acceptable compliance threshold of >=0.15. This non-compliance is primarily driven by a high number of 'repetition' deviations (1990 in Activation, 1653 in Awaiting). Additionally, 'Activation' also exhibits a significant number of 'missing' deviations (544).

**Recommendation:** The Responder must prioritize investigating the root causes of these excessive repetitions and missing steps in the 'Activation' and 'Awaiting' phases. Remediation efforts should focus on process streamlining and enforcement to ensure consistent execution, thereby improving overall compliance."
151,7,"All assessed process activities currently exhibit ""critical"" average fitness (ranging from 0.10 to 0.17), indicating a widespread systemic issue with process conformance. Specifically, the 'Activation' (0.10) and 'Awaiting' (0.14) activities fall below their minimum acceptable average fitness of 0.15. Additionally, significant non-compliance exists due to excessive deviations: 'Detection' has 319 missing and 1777 repetition deviations (exceeding <=20 and <=500 respectively); 'Activation' shows 544 missing, 1990 repetition, and 115 mismatch deviations (exceeding <=200, <=500, and <=50); 'Awaiting' has 1653 repetition deviations (exceeding <=200); and 'Resolution' reports 119 repetition and 45 mismatch deviations (exceeding <=50 and <=20).

**Recommendation:** Urgent remediation is required for the 'Activation' activity, which fails on both average fitness and all deviation types. Furthermore, intensive process enforcement and training must be implemented for 'Detection', 'Awaiting', and 'Resolution' to address the high volume of missing, repetition, and mismatch deviations, aiming to significantly improve adherence to the reference model."
151,8,"Overall incident management compliance is poor, with key activities exhibiting critical non-compliance. Specifically, 'Activation' (0.1) and 'Awaiting' (0.14) fall below the acceptable fitness threshold of >=0.15. Furthermore, 'Detection', 'Activation', 'Awaiting', and 'Resolution' show critically high deviations in missing, repetition, and/or mismatch categories (e.g., 'Activation' has 544 missing, 1990 repetitions, 115 mismatches) and alarmingly long average durations significantly exceeding acceptable limits (e.g., 'Activation' averaging 12655 min vs. <=4320 min acceptable).

**Required Remediation:**
A thorough investigation into the root causes of these high deviations and prolonged durations in 'Detection', 'Activation', 'Awaiting', and 'Resolution' is immediately required. This likely necessitates process re-engineering for these activities, including re-evaluating workflows, improving training, and optimizing resource allocation to ensure adherence to defined process steps and target completion times."
151,9,"Incident management compliance for recorded IT security incidents is low. Average fitness for 'Activation' (0.1) and 'Awaiting' (0.14) are below their acceptable threshold of 0.15. Significant deviations, including high 'missing' and 'repetition' counts in 'Detection' (319, 1777), 'Activation' (544, 1990), 'Awaiting' (1653 repetition), and 'Resolution' (119 repetition, 45 mismatch) severely impede process conformance across nearly all activities. Remediation is required to identify and address the root causes of these deviations to improve adherence to the defined incident management model."
151,10,"The average fitness compliance for the ""Activation"" (0.1) and ""Awaiting"" (0.14) activities is critically below the acceptable threshold of `>= 0.15`. For ""Activation"", all deviation types (missing: 544, repetition: 1990, mismatch: 115) far exceed their acceptable limits (200, 500, 50 respectively), and the average time (8d 18h 55min) is well above the non-acceptable threshold (5 days). For ""Awaiting"", repetition deviations (1653) are significantly over the acceptable limit (200), and the average time (16d 8h 10min) is critically high, exceeding the non-acceptable threshold (10 days).

**Recommendation:**
Focus immediate remediation efforts on the ""Activation"" and ""Awaiting"" phases. Implement stricter controls or automated checks to reduce missing, repetition, and mismatch deviations in ""Activation"". For ""Awaiting"", prioritize reducing repetitions and investigate the causes of excessive delays to bring average times down within acceptable limits for both activities."
152,1,"The average durations for Detection (4d 6h 35min), Activation (8d 18h 55min), Awaiting (16d 8h 10min), and Resolution (5d 22h 11min) critically exceed their respective non-acceptable time thresholds (2880 min, 7200 min, 14400 min, 4320 min). These extended durations indicate severe process efficiency impediments.

**Recommendation:**
Prioritize an immediate investigation into the root causes of these prolonged durations for Detection, Activation, Awaiting, and Resolution activities. Focus on analyzing contributing factors such as the high frequency of repetitions (e.g., Activation: 1990, Detection: 1777, Awaiting: 1653) and missing events (e.g., Detection: 319, Activation: 544) to identify bottlenecks and streamline workflows for future reduction."
152,2,"All activities except closure significantly impede process efficiency, with average durations well beyond their 'nonAcceptableTime' thresholds. Specifically, 'detection' (6155 min vs. non-acceptable 2880 min), 'activation' (12655 min vs. 7200 min), 'awaiting' (23530 min vs. 14400 min), and 'resolution' (8531 min vs. 4320 min) indicate critical bottlenecks. The 'awaiting' state is the most severe, averaging over 16 days. Remediation requires prioritizing improvements in initial incident triage for 'activation', optimizing resource allocation to minimize 'awaiting' times, and enhancing tools/training to expedite 'detection' and 'resolution' processes."
152,3,"The assessment reveals significant efficiency impediments in most incident management activities based on average durations. The ""awaiting"" state averages 16 days, 8 hours, 10 minutes (23530 minutes), far exceeding its non-acceptable threshold of 14400 minutes. Similarly, ""activation"" (8 days, 18 hours, 55 minutes or 12655 minutes), ""resolution"" (5 days, 22 hours, 11 minutes or 8531 minutes), and ""detection"" (4 days, 6 hours, 35 minutes or 6155 minutes) are all well above their respective non-acceptable thresholds (7200, 4320, and 2880 minutes). Only ""closure"" (0 days, 0 hours, 40 minutes) is within the acceptable time of 720 minutes.

**Recommendation and Remediation:**
Focus immediate remediation on streamlining the ""awaiting,"" ""activation,"" ""resolution,"" and ""detection"" phases. This should involve reviewing handoff procedures, resource allocation, and potential automation opportunities to significantly reduce these non-compliant average durations."
152,4,"The average activity durations indicate significant process inefficiency, with detection (N: 4d 6h 35min), activation (A: 8d 18h 55min), awaiting (W: 16d 8h 10min), and resolution (R: 5d 22h 11min) all greatly exceeding their acceptable and non-acceptable time thresholds. The ""awaiting"" (W) state, in particular, is a critical bottleneck, surpassing its 5-day acceptable limit by over 11 days.

**Recommendation:** Investigate and identify the root causes for the excessively long durations in the detection, activation, awaiting, and resolution phases.

**Required Remediation:** Implement measures to streamline these activities, focusing particularly on reducing time spent in the 'awaiting' state (e.g., through improved communication, resource allocation, or process automation)."
152,5,"The ""awaiting"" (W) activity severely impedes process efficiency with an average duration of 16 days, 8 hours, 10 minutes, which is well above the non-acceptable threshold of 10 days (14400 minutes). This prolonged duration is significantly influenced by a high number of repetitions in this state (1653 instances). For future reduction in activity durations, investigate the root causes of incidents frequently returning to or remaining in the ""awaiting"" state."
152,6,"The average durations for Detection (4d 6h 35min), Activation (8d 18h 55min), Awaiting (16d 8h 10min), and Resolution (5d 22h 11min) significantly exceed their respective non-acceptable time thresholds. The 'Awaiting' activity shows the longest average duration, strongly impeding overall process efficiency. Remediation requires immediate investigation into the root causes for these prolonged durations, particularly for 'Awaiting' and 'Activation' states, to identify opportunities for process streamlining, automation, or improved resource allocation. The 'Closure' activity is the only one performing within acceptable limits."
152,7,"The average durations for Detection (N: 4d 6h 35min), Activation (A: 8d 18h 55min), Awaiting (W: 16d 8h 10min), and Resolution (R: 5d 22h 11min) severely impede process efficiency, as they significantly exceed their non-acceptable thresholds (N: >= 2880 min, A: >= 7200 min, W: >= 14400 min, R: >= 4320 min). Remediation is required to reduce these durations, particularly by investigating the high number of repetitions (e.g., Activation: 1990, Awaiting: 1653) and mismatches (e.g., Activation: 115) contributing to critically low compliance (all < 0.18). Focus on streamlining workflows, automating repetitive tasks, and improving clarity in state transitions within these activities."
152,8,"The ""Awaiting"" activity is the most significant impediment to efficiency, averaging 16 days, which is far beyond the non-acceptable threshold of 14400 minutes. This is largely driven by an exceptionally high number of repetitions (1653 events), considerably exceeding the acceptable limit of 200. Similarly, ""Activation"" (8 days, 1990 repetitions) and ""Resolution"" (5 days, 119 repetitions) also exhibit critical durations and high repetition deviations. Remediation efforts should prioritize a root cause analysis for these excessive repetitions and implement process improvements or automation to reduce delays and re-work in these key stages."
152,9,"The average durations for Detection (6155 min), Activation (12655 min), Awaiting (23530 min), and Resolution (8531 min) are critically high, significantly exceeding their respective non-acceptable thresholds. The ""Awaiting"" state is the longest bottleneck, also showing critically high repetitions (1653 vs. <=200 acceptable), while the ""Activation"" state exhibits critically high missing, repetition, and mismatch deviations, directly impeding efficiency. Remediation is required to optimize these activities by reducing repetitions and other deviations to bring durations below the non-acceptable thresholds, as only the Closure activity (40 min) operates within acceptable limits."
152,10,"The average durations for Detection (6155 min), Activation (12655 min), Awaiting (23530 min), and Resolution (8531 min) are critically high, significantly exceeding their respective non-acceptable time thresholds. The 'Awaiting' state represents the most severe bottleneck, indicating substantial delays in incident progression. These prolonged durations impede process efficiency and correlate with critically low process fitness values (0.10-0.17) across most activities. To reduce future activity durations, responders should investigate the root causes of these delays, especially within the 'Awaiting' state, and implement targeted process improvements or resource re-allocation."
153,1,"All 370 incidents provided exhibit critical non-compliance, with fitness scores ranging from 0.19 to 0.5. The majority of these critical incidents consistently show `Impact=2`, `Urgency=2`, and `Priority=3`, indicating that even medium-severity incidents are poorly managed. This widespread process drift poses a significant risk of inefficient resolution, prolonged security exposures, and operational instability. Remediation requires an in-depth analysis of actual activity traces for incidents associated with the prevalent `Symptom 491` and common `Locations 204, 143, 161`, as well as `Categories 46, 26, 42, 53, 23, 57, 9` to pinpoint exact process deviations."
153,2,"All 498 analyzed incidents exhibit critical non-compliance, with fitness scores ranging from 0.19 to 0.50, indicating a systemic failure to adhere to the defined process. The majority of these incidents are consistently classified with Impact 2, Urgency 2, and Priority 3, yet show severe process deviations, suggesting a mismatch in classification or execution. This widespread non-compliance risks operational inefficiency, loss of control, and potential security gaps for moderately critical issues. Remediation requires a deep dive into specific activity deviations for common patterns like Symptom 491, Location 204, and Category 46, to either enforce process adherence through targeted training or re-evaluate the reference model for these incident types."
153,3,"The most critical non-compliant incidents, such as INC0032450 (fitness 0.190) and INC0025501 (fitness 0.207), all fall into the 'critical' compliance severity level (fitness <= 0.5), indicating significant deviations from the defined process. This non-compliance presents risks of delayed resolution, incorrect incident handling, and potential security gaps due to a substantial drift between the theoretical and practical process. To deep dive into root causes and propose targeted remediations, data on the actual process traces or state transitions for these specific critical incidents is required, as the current technical attribute data does not show specific process deviations."
153,4,"All listed incidents exhibit critical non-compliance, with fitness scores ranging from 0.19 (INC0032450) to 0.5, indicating severe deviations from the defined process model across a large number of incidents. The majority of these critically non-compliant incidents share common attributes: Impact 2, Urgency 2, and Priority 3, suggesting a systemic breakdown in handling standard or moderately severe incidents. This pervasive non-compliance poses a significant risk of inconsistent incident resolution and potential security vulnerabilities. A deep dive into the specific process traces of the lowest fitness incidents (e.g., INC0032450) is required to identify exact deviations and address systemic weaknesses, including investigating the frequent 'None' values for symptoms."
153,5,"All incidents listed in ""most_critical_incidents"" (e.g., INC0032450 with a fitness of 0.19) fall into the 'critical' compliance category (fitness <= 0.5), indicating severe deviations from the defined incident management process. This non-compliance risks unpredictable incident handling, delayed resolution of security issues, and increased operational vulnerabilities.

To address this, initiate a detailed root cause analysis focusing on incidents with missing symptom data (109 occurrences of 'None' symptom) to understand gaps in initial incident recording. Further investigate the process flows for incidents characterized by Symptom 491, Location 204, and Category 46, as these are the most frequent attributes among the non-compliant incidents, to identify specific points of deviation from the reference model."
153,6,"All provided incidents are critically non-compliant with fitness values ranging from 0.19 to 0.5, indicating severe deviations from the defined incident management process. This poses significant risks of inefficient handling, prolonged resolution, and potentially higher business impact, as evidenced by some incidents also having the highest technical priority (Impact=1, Urgency=1, Priority=1). A deep dive into activity specifics and process drift for these incidents is required, focusing on common attributes like Symptom 491, Locations 204, 161, 143, 93, and Categories 46, 34, 42 to identify root causes. Remediation should include process adjustments or targeted training for the identified areas to improve compliance."
153,7,"All 470+ incidents recorded between 2016-06-01 and 2016-07-01 exhibit critical non-compliance with a fitness score of 0.5 or less, with INC0032450 being the least compliant at 0.19. The pervasive non-compliance across these incidents, especially those frequently classified with Impact 2, Urgency 2, Priority 3, and specific Symptoms (e.g., 491, None), Locations (e.g., 204, 161, 143), and Categories (e.g., 46, 42, 23), poses a significant risk of inconsistent incident handling and delayed resolution. Remediation requires a deep dive into the process steps (detection, activation, awaiting, resolution, closure) for incidents sharing these common attributes to identify specific deviations and correct the drift between the theoretical and practical process, potentially through targeted training or process adjustments."
153,8,"All incidents listed (772 total) exhibit critical non-compliance, with fitness values ranging from 0.19 to 0.5. This low adherence poses significant risks, including operational inefficiencies, unpredictable incident resolution, and increased security exposure due to deviations from the defined process steps.

A deep dive into technical attributes reveals that the majority of these critically non-compliant incidents are of medium severity (Impact 2: 742, Urgency 2: 752, Priority 3: 725). Recurring hotspots for these deviations include locations 204, 143, 161, 93, and 51, and categories such as 46, 42, 53, 26, and 9.

Remediation requires focused training and process clarification for teams handling incidents with these common characteristics, specifically addressing why the defined process is not being followed in these identified locations and categories to improve compliance and mitigate risks."
153,9,"The most critical non-compliant incidents, such as INC0032450 with a fitness of 0.19, demonstrate severe deviations from the defined process, posing high operational and security risks due to unpredictable handling. A deep dive into these incidents reveals a prevalence of medium to critical priority (`impact: 2, urgency: 2, priority: 3`, or `impact: 1, urgency: 1, priority: 1`) issues, with frequently recurring attributes such as Symptom 491, Location 204, and Category 46. Remediation requires an immediate investigation into the specific process steps frequently missed or incorrectly executed for these common technical patterns, and addressing the high frequency of missing symptom data (None values) to reduce drift between theoretical and practical processes."
153,10,"As an Analyst, all 550 incidents provided are critically non-compliant, with fitness values ranging from 0.19 to 0.50, indicating significant process deviations. A deep dive into their characteristics reveals that approximately 90% are categorized with Impact 2, Urgency 2, and Priority 3, frequently originating from locations such as 204, 161, and 143. Notably, Symptom 491 is overwhelmingly prevalent in 257 incidents, while 104 incidents have no recorded symptom.

To remediate, focus investigation on process steps causing non-compliance for incidents linked to Symptom 491 and the dominant Impact/Urgency/Priority combinations. Additionally, address the lack of symptom data in 104 incidents to improve incident recording and facilitate future root cause analysis."
154,1,"As an Analyst, my focus is on identifying root causes and detailed process deviations through technical and individual incident analysis.

The technical analysis data reveals significant patterns:
*   **Most frequent symptom:** `491` appears 302 times, indicating a recurring technical issue. Additionally, ""None"" (missing symptom data) occurs 104 times, which is a major data quality issue preventing proper analysis.
*   **Most affected locations:** `204` is affected 108 times, `143` is affected 79 times, and `161` is affected 80 times, highlighting critical infrastructure points.
*   **Most affected categories:** `46` (102 times), `42` (67 times), and `26` (61 times) are the most frequent incident categories.

All incidents in the 'most_critical_incidents' view have fitness scores below 0.5 (critical compliance level), with the lowest being 0.19. This suggests a systemic failure in adhering to the incident management process, exacerbated by the lack of symptom reporting for 104 incidents.

**Recommendation:**
1.  **Mandate Symptom Reporting:** Implement a strict policy and technical controls to ensure a symptom is recorded for every incident, addressing the 104 ""None"" entries. This will improve data quality for root cause analysis.
2.  **Deep Dive into Top Offenders:** Conduct a detailed root cause analysis on incidents with symptom `491`, and those affecting locations `204`, `143`, `161`, and categories `46`, `42`, `26`, prioritizing incidents with the lowest fitness scores from the `most_critical_incidents` list (e.g., INC0032450 with fitness 0.19). This analysis should aim to identify common underlying issues and process deviations that contribute to low compliance and frequent occurrences.
3.  **Process Improvement:** Based on the deep dive, develop targeted remediation plans to address the identified root causes and process deviations. This may include updated procedures, training, or automation to improve compliance and reduce the recurrence of these specific technical issues."
154,2,"While the `technical_analysis` data provides detailed technical attributes (symptoms, locations, categories) necessary for analysis, the control ""Report Technical Analysis and most affected categories"" is not fully met as an aggregated report of these statistics is not explicitly provided. As an Analyst, using the provided data, it's identified that symptom 491, location 204, and category 42 are the most frequently occurring attributes across incidents.

**Required Remediation:**
To improve incident management compliance for this control, it is required to regularly generate and formalize a report that aggregates these technical statistics. This report should clearly present the most affected symptoms (e.g., Symptom 491 as the most frequent), locations (e.g., Location 204, 143, 161 being most frequent), and categories (e.g., Category 42, 46, 26 being most frequent) to effectively deduce frequently targeted IT assets and infrastructures."
154,3,"The overall incident process compliance is critical, with all listed incidents showing fitness values between 0.19 and 0.5. Technical analysis identifies Symptom 491 (172 incidents), Locations 204 (111 incidents), 161 (104 incidents), and Categories 46 (68 incidents), 53 (44 incidents) as most frequently affected. A significant data gap exists with 65 incidents having no recorded symptom, hindering thorough technical analysis. Remediation requires enforcing mandatory symptom recording and further investigating the underlying causes for incidents concentrated in the identified locations and categories to improve compliance and deduce frequently targeted IT assets."
154,4,"The provided `technical_analysis` data is sufficient for the Analyst to report technical statistics related to occurring symptoms, affected categories, and locations. Analysis shows Symptom 491 (228 occurrences), Category 46 (104 occurrences), and Location 204 (171 occurrences) are the most frequent. This enables the deduction of frequently targeted IT assets and infrastructures, fulfilling the ""Report Technical Analysis and most affected categories"" control's objective. No remediation for insufficient data is required for generating this report."
154,5,"The technical analysis data highlights Symptom 491, Category 46, and Location 204 as the most frequently occurring attributes, providing the necessary statistics for the 'Report Technical Analysis and most affected categories' control. However, all incidents in the selected period demonstrate critical process non-compliance (fitness values ranging from 0.19 to 0.5), indicating significant deviations from the reference model. Remediation should focus on an in-depth analysis of these widespread process non-compliances to identify root causes and ensure the consistency and accuracy of technical data collection and reporting. This will directly improve overall incident management compliance."
154,6,"The provided data successfully enables reporting of technical statistics as required by the control. Analysis shows that symptom `491` (202 occurrences), category `46` (82 occurrences), and location `204` (154 occurrences) are the most frequently recorded.

**Recommendation:**
As an Analyst, focus on investigating the root causes behind the high frequency of symptom `491`, category `46`, and incidents at location `204` to pinpoint the most targeted IT assets or infrastructure. Additionally, address the 70 incidents with unrecorded symptoms (`None`) to ensure comprehensive data for future analysis and compliance."
154,7,"Overall process compliance is critically low, with all recorded incidents exhibiting fitness values in the range of 0.19 to 0.5, falling entirely within the 'critical' threshold. Technical analysis indicates that Symptom 491 (172 occurrences), Category 46 (55 occurrences), and Location 204 (110 occurrences) are the most frequently reported attributes among these incidents. An in-depth root cause analysis for incidents linked to Symptom 491, Category 46, and Location 204 is urgently required to deduce frequently targeted IT assets and infrastructures, and inform targeted remediation efforts to improve overall incident management compliance."
154,8,"The incidents exhibit critical process compliance with fitness scores ranging from 0.19 to 0.50, all falling into the 'critical' severity level. Technical analysis reveals that Symptom 491 is the most frequent, followed by Symptom 534. Location 204 is the most affected (119 incidents), while Categories 46 (71 incidents) and 42 (63 incidents) are the most frequently targeted.

To improve incident management compliance, investigate the root causes behind the high occurrence of Symptom 491 and 534, focusing on IT assets in Location 204 and addressing issues within Categories 46 and 42. Analyzing these specific technical attributes can help identify underlying vulnerabilities or operational weaknesses that lead to frequent deviations from the reference model."
154,9,"The incident management compliance analysis for the 'Analyst' role regarding ""Report Technical Analysis and most affected categories"" reveals several key trends. Symptom '491' (198 occurrences), Category '46' (100 occurrences), and Location '204' (122 occurrences) are overwhelmingly the most frequently observed attributes. This indicates that a significant number of incidents share common technical characteristics and are concentrated in specific areas, suggesting potential vulnerabilities or recurring issues within those IT assets or infrastructures.

**Recommendation:**
The organization should prioritize an in-depth root cause analysis for Symptom '491', incidents categorized as '46', and those occurring at Location '204'. This targeted analysis, focusing on these high-frequency attributes, will allow the Analyst to deduce frequently targeted IT assets and infrastructures, leading to more effective remediation strategies and improved overall incident management compliance."
154,10,"All analyzed incidents exhibit critical process fitness (0.19 to 0.5), indicating severe deviations from the reference model. Technical analysis reveals that 'symptom 491' is the most frequent (173 occurrences), alongside a significant number of incidents (104) lacking symptom details. Locations '204' (140 incidents), '143' (104 incidents), and '161' (103 incidents) are most affected, while categories '46' (78 incidents), '26' (63 incidents), and '53' (52 incidents) are most impacted.

**Recommendation / Required Remediation:**
As an Analyst, immediate remediation is required for data quality by enforcing mandatory symptom reporting to eliminate ""None"" entries. Further, conduct in-depth root cause analysis for symptom '491' and prioritize investigations for IT assets and infrastructure in locations '204', '143', '161' and categories '46', '26', '53' to improve process compliance."
